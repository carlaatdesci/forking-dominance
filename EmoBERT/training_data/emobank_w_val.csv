276,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n-alkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task, perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun, causing a different ratio of n-alkanes to n-alkenes and the presence of branched n-alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile (Wagner, et al, 2001, as cited in Gordon & Greene, 2003)."
277,0.5,0.55,0.5,Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots.
278,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007)."
279,0.4575,0.4575,0.5425,"Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35)."
280,0.5,0.5625,0.5,"This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots."
281,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain."
282,0.55,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants.
283,0.5,0.5,0.5,Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs.
284,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt."
285,0.5,0.4375,0.5,The Behavior
286,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked."
287,0.5,0.55,0.5,Common Behaviors
288,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:"
289,0.5,0.5,0.55,Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil.
290,0.5,0.375,0.5625,"In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location."
291,0.55,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters."
292,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them."
293,0.5,0.125,0.5,The code may look something like this:
294,0.5,0.4175,0.5,The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.”
295,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models."
296,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine."
297,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996)."
298,0.55,0.55,0.55,The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior.
299,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems."
300,0.5,0.4,0.55,"The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
301,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005)."
302,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
303,0.5,0.5,0.5,"An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit."
304,0.5,0.5,0.5,A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food.

306,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon."
307,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors."
308,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot."
309,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,"Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler."

311,0.6,0.6,0.6,Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system.
312,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors."
313,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging."
314,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day."
315,0.5,0.5,0.6,A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached.
316,0.5,0.5,0.6,"The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius."
317,0.5,0.5,0.5,The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects.
318,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions."
319,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733).
320,0.5,0.55,0.55,Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture.
321,0.5625,0.625,0.5,"Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia."
322,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole."
323,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59)."
324,0.5,0.4,0.55,"The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005)."
325,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so."
326,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.

329,0.5,0.5,0.5,"By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82)."

331,0.5,0.5,0.5,By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.

404,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,”"
405,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Exposition
406,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings."
407,0.5,0.4175,0.5,This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2/8 measures).
408,0.5,0.5,0.55,"While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76-94, these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F."
409,0.5,0.5,0.5,"E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131."
410,0.5,0.5,0.5,B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it.
411,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Paul Wilson points out that “[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”"
412,0.5,0.5,0.5,Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction.
413,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the “theme” of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme."
414,0.5,0.375,0.5,"The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation."
415,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement."
416,0.5,0.4,0.5,"See Wilson, 168-170."
417,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum."
418,0.5,0.5,0.5,References
419,0.55,0.5,0.5,"While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure."
420,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Bartók’s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure."
421,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"When we say “in F,” we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)—the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement."
422,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg."
423,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition."
424,0.5,0.5,0.5,"See Bartók, 414-415."
425,0.5,0.5,0.55,"In this particular movement, Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections."
426,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper."
427,0.5,0.5,0.55,If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.
428,0.5,0.5,0.55,So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth.
429,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2."
430,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor."

839,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"No, we're the start of a rebellion."
840,0.16749999999999998,0.5,0.3325,"“That's dumb,”"
841,0.25,0.75,0.75,"“That's dumb,” said Sarah."
842,0.55,0.55,0.55,“The captain selected us for a reason.
843,0.55,0.35,0.44999999999999996,“The captain selected us for a reason. He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us? He knows about us.”
844,0.5,0.5,0.5,I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that.
845,0.4,0.6,0.4,"Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright."
846,0.5,0.5,0.625,He sounded certain.
847,0.4,0.6,0.65,“You've got it all wrong.”
848,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"He looked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me."
849,0.5,0.5,0.5,Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet.
850,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"“You can try to hold on,” said Ray."
851,0.4,0.5,0.5,"But words, if you repeat them enough times, lose their meaning."
852,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,No longer grounded.”
853,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"“Leaving your wife, I mean. Traveling on this ship.”"
854,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Ray shrugged, then got up and left."
855,0.5,0.5,0.5,she asked me.
856,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,I shrugged.
857,0.55,0.5,0.5,I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing.
858,0.5,0.4,0.6,“What did you do before this? How were you found?”
859,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.65,Fact: Sound is a vibration.
860,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"“I'm going to figure it out,”"
861,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“How and why this ship exists.
862,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“How and why this ship exists. I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”"
863,0.25,0.5625,0.3125,Fact: Adrienne intimidated me.
864,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.
865,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,“People do leave. The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same. But we see new faces.”
866,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.4,“You're sure it's not just some people being indisposed ? ”
867,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.44999999999999996,"asked Adrienne, using Sarah's phrasing."
868,0.55,0.55,0.55,Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance.
869,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink.
870,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,"After a moment, Ray said, “I don't think so.”"
871,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“I don't think so.”
872,0.5,0.6,0.44999999999999996,“Who leaves?”
873,0.4,0.55,0.4,"I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing."
874,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,No one contradicted her.
875,0.7,0.7,0.7,Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted.
876,0.5,0.5,0.55,"From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same."
877,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that...
878,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"“Days don't matter,”"
879,0.5,0.5,0.5625,“Why are you so interested?”
880,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Disappeared,”"
881,0.55,0.6,0.7,“Do you want to leave?”
882,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“I wouldn't miss this, much.”"
883,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm, neck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I ruminated on the situation."
884,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful.
885,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,That was all.
886,0.5,0.6,0.55,I wanted my contentment back.
887,0.55,0.5,0.6,"In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items."
888,0.5425,0.5,0.5825,"She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along."
889,0.3325,0.5825,0.4175,"She gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me."
890,0.5,0.55,0.6,"I explained, in two brief sentences, my earlier impasse."
891,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“I don't know much,”"
892,0.3325,0.5,0.5,“I've been having headaches.”
893,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,All hours.”
894,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill?
895,0.5,0.55,0.55,“The captain?”
896,0.5,0.5825,0.4175,Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face.
897,0.55,0.4,0.55,"“At least have a drink,”"
898,0.5825,0.5,0.5825,"Once found, we can never be lost."
899,0.5,0.4,0.6,This is our Hotel California.
900,0.4575,0.375,0.5425,"But ultimately, this ship, its purpose, our purpose—did it matter?"
901,0.5,0.375,0.375,"And all of us, we were permanent characters in each others' stories."
902,0.5,0.5625,0.5,"“So, I'm on a ship now?"
903,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Some nights,”"
904,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,I ran.
905,0.4,0.5,0.55,I didn't want to forget.
906,0.5,0.55,0.55,"The last thing I remember, I was tearing down the corridors."
907,0.5,0.5,0.5,A space station.
908,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,Some other ship.
909,0.4,0.55,0.5,"Ray, he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls, finding no glass to break."
910,0.65,0.35,0.5,"“Relax,”"
911,0.5,0.5,0.4175,Why didn't you save them?”
912,0.6,0.6,0.55,"“It'll pass,” he told me."
913,0.6,0.6,0.55,He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing.
914,0.35,0.55,0.5,Who would tell his girl how he had died?
915,0.5,0.4,0.55,“You fit the bill.
916,0.5625,0.5,0.5,"Tiffany, she looked at the captain, grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder."
917,0.5,0.5,0.5,She turned to me.
918,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.7,No time for questions.
919,0.5,0.55,0.55,"No seventy-two virgins, but it would do."
920,0.5,0.5,0.5,Tiffany looked back.
921,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“No, I meant, where's the ship going?"
922,0.5,0.55,0.5,"“No, I meant, where's the ship going? What's our destination?”"
923,0.5,0.4175,0.5,What's our destination?”
924,0.7,0.7,0.6,“You're going to be delighted. Destination everywhere. Destination nowhere.”
925,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Initially, I couldn't figure out why—I hadn't requested any be sent."
926,0.5,0.5,0.4175,"I must have consumed it, too, because later on, the plates and the bottle were both empty."
927,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed, staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling, or slumped in the old-fashioned armchair, staring out the windows at the stars."
928,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.44999999999999996,Cliques form in any decent-sized group of people.
929,0.6875,0.6875,0.5625,"Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it was mouthwateringly, lip-smackingly gorgeous."
930,0.6875,0.5,0.6875,"“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh? I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”"
931,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”"
932,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"I looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest."
933,0.5,0.5,0.55,The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot.
934,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her."
935,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Clearly, it was a high-end model."
936,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,"I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later."
937,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,This is more than the person would have sans space suit.
938,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact."
939,0.6,0.55,0.6,"Pretty cool, right?"
940,0.55,0.55,0.55,All those fans wanted their free burgers and they wanted them now!

943,0.5425,0.5,0.5,"That's not a bonus item, it's now a standard part of the agreement."
944,0.55,0.6,0.55,Want me as a fan?
945,0.4175,0.4575,0.5425,"I'm not saying that special bonuses, or 'surprise and delight' offers aren't ever a good thing."

1020,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Dear Ms. LastName
1021,0.6,0.5,0.5,P.S. Please accept the enclosed 2001 calendar and gift tags as a special greeting from our animal friends and Little Shelter.
1022,0.3325,0.3325,0.3325,"These are the pawprints of a homeless animal; an abandoned animal, shivering with fear, with no place to call home."

1025,0.5,0.5,0.5,She had the look of every leader she had ever known.
1026,0.55,0.65,0.55,Her glowering expression completed the imposing effect.
1027,0.5,0.5,0.5,"She picked imaginary flecks off her stark gray jumpsuit, and snorted."
1028,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,She used the discretion of the mirrored window to secretively survey her crew.
1029,0.5,0.55,0.4,"She seemed so depthless - self conscious and shallow on the outside, but having that incredible gift."
1030,0.5,0.5,0.5,"His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat."

1039,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"Two quintessential novellas, “The Lust of the White Serpant” from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and “Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda” a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal."

1056,0.5,0.6,0.75,“Tell me anyway.
1057,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"“Nathan,”"
1058,0.35,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it."
1059,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.65,"In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets."
1060,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here.
1061,0.5,0.4,0.55,I mean – ”
1062,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"“Just ignore that,”"
1063,0.5,0.5,0.5,“You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.”
1064,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes.
1065,0.4,0.55,0.30000000000000004,“Is it really safe to leave the car …”
1066,0.4,0.55,0.6,"Someone opened it a crack, then ushered us in."
1067,0.6,0.7,0.65,"Sometimes we'd get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges, and we'd rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up."
1068,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Then I looked down and saw what had let us in.
1069,0.5,0.5,0.5,The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap.
1070,0.30000000000000004,0.7,0.65,“Who’s the freak?”
1071,0.3325,0.6675,0.5,"It pulled back around his fingertips, which bore things that might have been nails or claws."
1072,0.625,0.25,0.5,Nepthys quickly answered for me.
1073,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"Nepthys nodded: “It’s okay, you can trust him."
1074,0.55,0.55,0.55,It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly.
1075,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He was slim, almost drawn, but he had a kind of … luster to him, I guess."
1076,0.55,0.55,0.55,“I get that all the time around here.”
1077,0.5,0.5,0.5,He really stood out.
1078,0.5,0.5,0.5,That’s why I couldn’t understand why no-one else remembered him.
1079,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,“What do you think?”
1080,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"I can send you to a guy who knows all about them, though."
1081,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,It won’t be long before nightfall.”
1082,0.5625,0.4375,0.5,"“Oh yeah, man."
1083,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"Here, let me write down how to find him.”"
1084,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys."
1085,0.8325,0.7075,0.5,Good luck!”
1086,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,That last one was to me.
1087,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor."
1088,0.5,0.5,0.5,I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light.
1089,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver."
1090,0.5,0.5,0.55,"At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional."
1091,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Setting an arm on my shoulder, he said, “Nathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you."
1092,0.55,0.55,0.5,They’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms.”
1093,0.65,0.55,0.55,It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity.”
1094,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“It’s from Mitch,”"
1095,0.4,0.5,0.5,"“Nathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel."
1096,0.55,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"Until thirty seconds ago, I didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of …weirdness.”"
1097,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.65,"Now, can we get going?”"
1098,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,“Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name.”
1099,0.55,0.55,0.55,"“What is your name, anyway?”"
1100,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence."
1101,0.5,0.55,0.5,"“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east."
1102,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"“Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left."
1103,0.4,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust."
1104,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back."
1105,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,"The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East."
1106,0.5,0.5,0.35,I’m not sure I’m up for a night out.”
1107,0.55,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place."
1108,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"“We’re not here to browse,”"
1109,0.65,0.65,0.5,"Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged."
1110,0.5,0.25,0.55,I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.”
1111,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"“True, true."
1112,0.55,0.55,0.55,Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart.
1113,0.4,0.4,0.5,"“Sorry, kid."
1114,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,–Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual?”
1115,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.5,"“Wait, Nepthys – you said nothing about vampires."
1116,0.5,0.5,0.4,There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are.
1117,0.4575,0.5,0.5425,"They’re almost as rare here, and I’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire.”"
1118,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great."
1119,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?”
1120,0.625,0.5,0.625,"Let’s go together, you know you’ll have fun once you get into it.”"
1121,0.4575,0.5,0.5425,"It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the ""second sight"", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times."
1122,0.4175,0.5825,0.4175,"Finally, in a pinched rasp, he said, “My information is purely for the purposes of a collector."
1123,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"He continued to lie in place, still breathing heavily."
1124,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"“Of course we will fetch you the stone,”"
1125,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone."
1126,0.4,0.6,0.5,"When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant."
1127,0.4,0.6,0.55,Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them.
1128,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d’s light, and handcuffed."
1129,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“No, thank you,”"
1130,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“I am Madame Entera, at your service."
1131,0.5,0.4175,0.5,“Are you?
1132,0.5,0.5,0.5,"We’ve had genies, indentured sorcerers, even golems and the occasional elf."
1133,0.5,0.5,0.625,"“Let’s not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache?"
1134,0.6675,0.6675,0.5,“That such a rock could hold so much magic – it’s a wonder.”
1135,0.6,0.5,0.5,"“He looks healthy,”"
1136,0.2,0.7,0.6,I’m not giving my blood.”
1137,0.6,0.6,0.6,"“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,”"
1138,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me."
1139,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,It must have been larger than my finger.
1140,0.4575,0.4575,0.4575,"The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin."
1141,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,I thought that I could feel a slight itching.
1142,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"“They take about a quarter-pint each,”"
1143,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech."
1144,0.5,0.55,0.5,Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber.
1145,0.75,0.6,0.55,"“Thank you for doing business at our house, and I hope to see you again!”"
1146,0.5,0.55,0.55,"“Vodka, straight up,”"
1147,0.5,0.55,0.6,“and a Bloody Mary for my friend.
1148,0.5,0.5825,0.5825,"“Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?"
1149,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Okay, take elves.”"
1150,0.35,0.5,0.55,Not in America.
1151,0.4,0.65,0.4,"Here, they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world, too, right?"
1152,0.6675,0.5,0.5,There’s an amazing DJ who’s an elf.
1153,0.5,0.5,0.5,They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary.
1154,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected."
1155,0.55,0.55,0.5,"I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river."
1156,0.5,0.5,0.55,"As we left the bar, I asked to see the rock."
1157,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to touch it.”"
1158,0.5825,0.5,0.5,I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside.
1159,0.65,0.7,0.65,Even the city feels alive when spring comes.”
1160,0.4,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind."
1161,0.4,0.5,0.6,"“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,”"
1162,0.4,0.4,0.55,"The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs."
1163,0.5,0.5,0.5,You woke it up?
1164,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“But …but sir,”"
1165,0.35,0.65,0.55,"Now leave, before I call the rats on you.”"
1166,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.44999999999999996,Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck.
1167,0.55,0.55,0.6,"Come on, we’re heading out.”"
1168,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine."
1169,0.5,0.5,0.65,"First, though, we are getting you a hat."
1170,0.5,0.5625,0.5,“Dead Can Dance”
1171,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Amy liked it, I think."
1172,0.5,0.5,0.5,“A Forest”
1173,0.5,0.3325,0.5,The man closed his eyes.
1174,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in."
1175,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade, a vaulted, ribbed intestine of a hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic."
1176,0.5,0.5,0.5,These were incontestably male.
1177,0.5,0.5,0.5625,I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes.
1178,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,” said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk."
1179,0.55,0.6,0.55,"“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,”"
1180,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,I asked.
1181,0.5,0.5,0.5625,He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me.
1182,0.5,0.4375,0.625,"“She may be at that,” said Isis, gazing at her."
1183,0.4375,0.5625,0.5625,"Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying."
1184,0.5,0.7,0.44999999999999996,"Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts."
1185,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,“It is.
1186,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,He should be.
1187,0.5,0.375,0.5,Let me see if I can find him.”
1188,0.5,0.5,0.55,"She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest."
1189,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“but he might know that someone’s looking for him. He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.
1190,0.4,0.5,0.5,"He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes."

1364,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries, and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers to pay much less for work."
1365,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy."
1366,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.65,“You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”
1367,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the entire steel community in America.
1368,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,The events that would follow this date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope.
1369,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people."
1370,0.4,0.5,0.5,No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems.
1371,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did."
1372,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had."
1373,0.5,0.5,0.55,"People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town."
1374,0.55,0.55,0.5,"However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food."
1375,0.5,0.375,0.5625,Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist.
1376,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side."
1377,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations."
1378,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures."
1379,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate."
1380,0.5,0.4,0.5,Conclusion: The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday
1381,0.4,0.55,0.55,"But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures."
1382,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines, or even began living on the streets."
1383,0.5,0.5,0.55,"The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on."
1384,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.4,But why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail?
1385,0.4,0.55,0.5,"When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry."
1386,0.5,0.5825,0.5,"Most importantly, the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem."
1387,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level."
1388,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”"
1389,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth."
1390,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"September 19, 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget."
1391,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin."
1392,0.3125,0.5,0.5625,"Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably."
1393,0.5,0.5825,0.6675,"The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways."
1394,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works."
1395,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government."
1396,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown."
1397,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export."
1398,0.25,0.6,0.35,The Decline of the World Market
1399,0.5,0.5,0.5,Foreign steel was also much cheaper.

1401,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Mine were more or less matzoh-ball size and shape, out of habit."
1402,0.5425,0.4175,0.5,"I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from downtown, and two vacant lots."
1403,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the freeway offramps.
1404,0.5,0.6,0.6,The first responsibility should be driving safely.
1405,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,You want both tidiness and easy access.
1406,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Plus, those things are crumbly."
1407,0.65,0.55,0.65,And the last lesson -- have fun .
1408,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Seedbombing is a hit-or-miss way for change to take root, pun intended."
1409,0.5,0.5,0.5,No one I know is getting digg'd or favrd yet for throwing color and scent around the ghetto.
1410,0.5,0.5,0.55,"For example, make smaller wildflower seedbombs and carefully 'plant' them in a meridian by making holes in the ground with your heel and then gently tamping the dirt over them with your sole."
1411,0.8,0.7,0.7,5. Enjoy.
1412,0.5,0.55,0.5,"The actions that you never do are absolutely perfectly effective, in your imagination."
1413,0.5,0.4175,0.5,The first step to seedbombing is:
1414,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Yeah, I know, ""Texas has plenty of blue bonnets,"" you say ..."
1415,0.5,0.5625,0.5,"We just made seedbombs for our holiday gift baskets; they're a mix of flowers from the yard, heavy on the poppies."

1680,0.6,0.55,0.5,"Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead."

1682,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done.
1683,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre."
1684,0.4,0.55,0.5,"His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers."
1685,0.4575,0.375,0.5,But he did not weep.
1686,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,The papers and the lantern's flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allan's window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door.
1687,0.4,0.55,0.55,"Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood."
1688,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,"As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants."
1689,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him.
1690,0.55,0.55,0.5,In the author's eye gleamed the lantern's reflection – or was it a reflection?
1691,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"His breath returning to its normal rhythms, he dared to look at the page before him."
1692,0.5,0.5,0.55,"His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders."
1693,0.55,0.55,0.55,"For a few yards, they kicked up dust along the roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to the air."
1694,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky."
1695,0.3325,0.5,0.4175,Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation.
1696,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill."""
1697,0.375,0.625,0.5,"Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish."
1698,0.4575,0.5,0.4575,"My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road."""

1701,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""Perhaps it would,"""
1702,0.5,0.5,0.5625,Arthur rose and shook his hand.

1704,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.55,"He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust."
1705,0.55,0.65,0.55,The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree.
