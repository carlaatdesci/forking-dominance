21,0.6675,0.5825,0.5,"For every dollar donated to Goodwill in 1998, we helped our ""graduates"" earn an estimated $102."
22,0.5625,0.5,0.5625,"That money was then spent in a variety of ways, adding fuel to our thriving economy."
23,0.8,0.55,0.6,"She tells me that the 3,666 people we helped find jobs in 1998 earned approximately $49 million dollars."

65,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five ""Standout Good Guys."""

76,0.65,0.5,0.6,We've helped people break free of the welfare cycle.
77,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"December 10, 1996"
78,0.6675,0.5825,0.6675,We've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce.
79,0.65,0.5,0.55,We've expanded Goodwill's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are needed most.
80,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Of course, we've played different roles."
81,0.65,0.44999999999999996,0.6,You have helped make Goodwill's work possible with your previous support.
82,0.5,0.5,0.5,Dear Mailhouse donor reminder:
83,0.5,0.4,0.5,Goodwill has devised the programs that turned your investment into results.
84,0.6,0.65,0.6,Who has benefited from our partnership?
85,0.5,0.5,0.5,Everyone has.
86,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"When you and I help somebody find a job, one more person joins the ranks of tax payers, fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain another consumer."
87,0.6,0.5,0.44999999999999996,You and I have done some important work together.
88,0.625,0.5,0.5625,"At last, he has found success in a job that he loves."
89,0.5,0.5,0.5,Now his goals are set on moving up in the company.
90,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,"Every year, thousands of people come to Goodwill."
91,0.5,0.375,0.5,"Like Michael, they share two common characteristics."
92,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,They face some barrier to employment and they want to work.
93,0.6675,0.5825,0.6675,"With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it."
94,0.5,0.5,0.5825,And then the pay-off begins for the entire community.
95,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Last year, participants in Goodwill programs earned --and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $3.5 million."
96,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job.
97,0.5,0.4,0.5,"November 15, 1994"
98,0.65,0.4,0.55,Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three-quarters of a million dollars in public assistance.
99,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however."
100,0.55,0.55,0.6,"The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms of a house to live in, money to purchase food -- without food stamps -- and the beginning of a family focused on success, not hopelessness."
101,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Won't you help make all of these successes possible?
102,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,Please send the largest contribution you can comfortably make.
103,0.65,0.5,0.55,Your gift will help give new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason to use the word.
104,0.25,0.625,0.375,Michael was born with cerebral palsy.
105,0.5825,0.5,0.5825,"Sincerely,"
106,0.5,0.5,0.5,James M. McClelland President
107,0.5,0.5,0.5,P.S.
108,0.55,0.5,0.6,Your gift will make a difference.
109,0.75,0.6,0.6,"For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year, we returned $1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments."
110,0.65,0.5,0.5,"Upon entering the work force, he discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities."
111,0.5,0.4,0.5,For several years he performed packaging and clerical work.
112,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Dear ,"
113,0.5625,0.375,0.5625,Think of your greatest accomplishments.
114,0.25,0.5625,0.5,For 18 long months Michael could not find a job.
115,0.4,0.55,0.5,He resorted to public assistance dollars to survive.
116,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Finally, Michael called Goodwill."
117,0.55,0.5,0.5,"At Goodwill, Michael's counselors felt that his personable demeanor could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job-match where his people skills could shine."
118,0.65,0.5,0.6,"After three interviews, Michael proved that he was the right person for the job."
119,0.75,0.65,0.6,Think of the joy and success they bring to you and your loved ones.
120,0.5,0.4,0.4,"As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments, he now provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night."
121,0.5,0.5,0.5,Their complaint: the system discourages working because unemployment provides benefits that many entry-level jobs don't include.
122,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,Some of the strongest critics of our welfare system are the people who have become dependent on it.
123,0.55,0.5,0.65,That's where you --and Goodwill --come in.
124,0.55,0.4,0.4,We help people train for and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare.
125,0.65,0.5,0.55,"Last year, Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs, more than double the number we placed in 1993."
126,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea, the people who need jobs are floundering."
127,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,We need your support to continue getting people off of public assistance.
128,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,Welfare is not the answer.
129,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,And welfare reform is an uncertain solution with an unknown starting date.
130,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,Goodwill works.
131,0.5,0.375,0.625,Right now.
132,0.55,0.5,0.5,Please give the largest gift you can to Goodwill today.
133,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Sincerely, Jack Dustman Chairman"
134,0.35,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"With unemployment at its lowest point in years in central Indiana, many people still have a hard time finding meaningful employment."
135,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Some, like Jerry, are ex-offenders."
136,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Some are blind, deaf or have other physical disabilities."
137,0.25,0.5,0.5,More than 100 were homeless.
138,0.65,0.55,0.5,"But Goodwill offers hope even to people with numerous obstacles to overcome, like Jerry."
139,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"March 17, 2000"
140,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"For as long as he needs it, Goodwill will continue to help."
141,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"He knew he had made a bad mistake, but despite his commitment to rebuilding his life, he just didn't count on the obstacles that would be thrown up in his path."
142,0.6,0.4,0.55,Your support of Goodwill will provide job training and placement services to help the hardest to serve in central Indiana find meaningful employment.
143,0.6,0.30000000000000004,0.4,"And, with your assistance, Goodwill can help employers develop resources to keep workers on the job."
144,0.625,0.625,0.75,Please make an investment in the stability of our community by sending a gift to Goodwill.
145,0.625,0.5625,0.5,Your generosity will help people help themselves.

149,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,He went to the Center Township Trustee for food stamps until he could find a job and a place to live.
150,0.5,0.625,0.5,But Jerry's troubles didn't end there.
151,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The seasonal construction job he obtained soon ended, and he returned to Career Academy for help once more."
152,0.5,0.35,0.65,"When Jerry was released from prison, he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life."
153,0.4,0.5,0.4,"Unemployed, homeless and with a prison record, Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support."
154,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Such fund are often used for college tuition, vocational training or a deposit on an apartment."
155,0.25,0.6,0.4,"Without private donor support, this Fund doesn't exist."
156,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,Please take a few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children successfully cross that threshold into the future.

168,0.5,0.5,0.5,4. Possession of a high school diploma or GED
169,0.5,0.55,0.6,"Proof of meeting these, two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel, which determines if the applicant merits the funds."
170,0.5,0.5,0.5,Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil War.
171,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Today, we serve children and families with a multitude of problems: emotional, physical, psychological and sexual abuse."
172,0.6,0.5,0.55,"Some come from families where, through therapy, there is hope for reunification."
173,0.6,0.5,0.5,"For others, ""families"" are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live."
174,0.30000000000000004,0.44999999999999996,0.4,The biggest tragedy is that the problems don't go away; they only grow.
175,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"Little ones, like Baby Jessica, caught in the struggle between adoptive and birth parents."

208,0.4,0.55,0.4,"We all hear about today's increases in neglect, abuse and abandonment of those who can't fight back: children."
209,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.4,Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade.
210,0.7,0.6,0.55,The positive side.
211,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,These are special children.
212,0.5,0.5,0.5,It is a fund-raising appeal.
213,0.5,0.5,0.5,"whether it's for therapeutic help in their own homes (which nurtures whole families), through foster care families or in the familial surroundings of our residential homes."
214,0.625,0.625,0.625,Your contribution will make a difference in a child's life.
215,0.6,0.55,0.5,It may help a family stay together.
216,0.625,0.6875,0.6875,It can certainly make happy holiday memories.
217,0.65,0.6,0.5,A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have presents to open.
218,0.5625,0.4375,0.5,"A gift means a family will have a holiday meal, cooking utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on."
219,0.55,0.5,0.5,Your gift will go beyond the holiday season.
220,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"It can help purchase clothing, school supplies, books and educational tools throughout the year."
221,0.5825,0.5,0.6675,Please take a few minutes to mail a donation to Pleasant run.
222,0.6,0.55,0.5,Let our families and children know that you want them to have the same kinds of memories of the holidays you will have.
223,0.5,0.55,0.5,Dear Friends of Pleasant Run:

226,0.75,0.625,0.625,This is the time of year when we give thanks for the warmth and love that surrounds us.
227,0.5,0.5,0.5,And this time of year is an occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are.
228,0.55,0.5,0.5,Pleasant Run cares for at-risk children and families.
229,0.5,0.375,0.5425,"We do this through a wide range of programs including community- based, therapeutic foster care, group homes and our treatment center."
230,0.55,0.55,0.5,"The holiday season is the time of year when we're all busy buying gifts, baking goodies, decorating our homes and making arrangements to be with family and friends."
231,0.4,0.55,0.55,Many of the children are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes.
232,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.4,Many of the children have no homes; no memories of joy from past holidays.
233,0.4,0.5,0.4,"Others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy, happy environment but don't have the resources to make it possible."
234,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"If you are interested and would like more information, please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693-9222."

238,0.55,0.65,0.65,It's hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away.
239,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Every year we seek companies, organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families."
240,0.55,0.55,0.55,These families are participants in our community-based programs.
241,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,These programs focus on keeping the family together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family.
242,0.35,0.4,0.5,"After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils, beds, cleaning supplies, etc."
243,0.55,0.55,0.6,We meet these needs immediately.
244,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"But, the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families."
245,0.4375,0.5,0.5,They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal.
246,0.55,0.55,0.6,We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season.
247,0.55,0.4,0.4,"At Pleasant Run, Inc. we are making plans and arrangements for our children and families."

450,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Its purpose is to encourage collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies, programs, and systems that serve our community's youth."
451,0.55,0.6,0.44999999999999996,Dear Bill:
452,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"In addition to that behind-the-scenes role, MCCOY has taken an out-front role in developing a Summer Bus Pass, neighborhood youth councils, and the We Value Youth information line."
453,0.55,0.5,0.5,"This is the time of year when our thoughts turn to ways to do things differently, things that will make our lives better and improve the quality of our life."
454,0.6,0.6,0.6,McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decision-making and program planning processes.
455,0.5,0.3325,0.5,"One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne, Indiana."

457,0.65,0.6,0.6,"As a team, these three organizations are working with neighborhood youth and adults to build a ""Caring Neighborhood with Youth"" , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a better neighborhood for all."
458,0.5825,0.4175,0.5,"Since its re-organization, MCCOY has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best: helping to identify youth needs, convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs, and moving toward collaborative solutions."
459,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,McCoy has only one interest: the well being of Marion County's young people.
460,0.5,0.4375,0.4375,"McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount of $10,000.00 to support such activities as:"
461,0.55,0.55,0.55,---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood-based youth councils;
462,0.5625,0.5625,0.625,---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities;
463,0.5,0.5,0.5,---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery;
464,0.55,0.55,0.6,---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth-adult relationships;
465,0.5425,0.4175,0.5,---- the development of community-wide supports for the positive growth of all Marion County young people.
466,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"It retained, however, the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception: to serve as a catalyst for effective, coordinated, and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community."
467,0.5,0.4,0.5,Youth who are supported and encouraged by both a family and a society that values Them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and contributing members of adult society.
468,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"While we have made significant inroads, there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do it alone."

1016,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"He certainly does not ""attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered"" and, as noted above, doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if Moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is."
1017,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence.

1032,0.375,0.5,0.5825,"You make the hysterical claim that the interview ""may be faked"" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death?"
1033,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"It also raises questions about America's foreign policy of recent decades, questions which have been all but ignored by Moore's critics."

1036,0.4,0.6,0.4,"Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of ""Bowling"" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston."

1038,0.4,0.5,0.5,"The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly."
1039,0.5,0.5,0.625,"In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is ""full of lies""."

1083,0.375,0.5,0.625,"After the September 11 attacks, it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the US government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour."
1084,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001.
1085,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies."
1086,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords, it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid -- the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage."

1089,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.6,9) Gun homicides.
1090,0.4,0.5,0.5,That's because they know all too well that Moore is correct: The United States have a far greater homicide rate (both gun- and non-gun) than most other first world countries.
1091,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"His main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data, his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources (and, as you correctly point out, he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries)."
1092,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website.
1093,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology."
1094,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: Japan: 0.02 per 100,000 (1994)England/Wales: 0.11 per 100,000 (1997)Germany: 0.22 per 100,000 (1994)Australia: 0.44 per 100,000 (1994)United States: 3.72 per 100,000 (1999)"
1095,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,"Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make -- concluding that gun ownership ""leads"" to violence."
1096,0.5,0.55,0.55,"In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited."
1097,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.6,It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence -- but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly.
1098,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John ""Mary"" Lott."
1099,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"If these causes were addressed, gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem (but also unnecessary); just like it is in Switzerland."

1109,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"If anything, it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with ""having a more mixed ethnicity""."
1110,0.3325,0.625,0.5425,"Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved."
1111,0.35,0.55,0.5,Heston's answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful.
1112,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In this case, Hanlon's Razor can be applied to Heston -- he is probably not racist, but incompetent."

1120,0.6,0.6,0.55,"What is true is that Bowling for Columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries, one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of American culture."
1121,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Other than towards the NRA, the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and comes up with some thoughtful answers."
1122,0.30000000000000004,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Obviously, media propaganda can incite people to kill."
1123,0.35,0.6,0.5,The most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against Moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics.
1124,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Had Moore wanted to make a propaganda film, he would have used other material: photos from America's Emergency Rooms."
1125,0.6,0.5,0.6,"Certainly, Moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the United States today, and his film fully deserved its Oscar."
1126,0.4,0.55,0.5,"The shrill (and remarkably unsuccessful) Internet campaign to ""revoke"" his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the film's accuracy."
1127,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven."
1128,0.65,0.65,0.55,"It is not only the highest grossing non-music documentary of all time, among the users of the largest Internet film database, IMDB, it is also the highest rated one."
1129,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"According to the LA Times, the documentary genre ""owes a huge debt to Michael Moore"" -- after Bowling's success, films like ""Spellbound"" and ""Capturing the Friedmans"" were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely."
1130,0.55,0.55,0.44999999999999996,But perhaps the campaign against Moore is really motivated by another reason.
1131,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.5,"It is unlikely, however, that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact."
1132,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,"After all, the same kind of PR blitz was started against the previous record-holding documentary: ""Roger & Me"" by Michael Moore."
1133,0.5,0.4,0.5,This text is in the public domain.
1134,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Moore's hypothesis (which apparently comes at least in part from the book ""Culture of Fear"" by Barry Glassner, also advertised on Moore's website) is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia, which itself can lead to violent acts."
1135,0.375,0.5,0.5625,Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award.
1136,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence."
1137,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"It is no surprise, however, that US (and European) media do not question their own propaganda of fear."
1138,0.5,0.375,0.5,"Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists."
1139,0.35,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Children who grow up in war-torn regions are known for having similar views -- war is perceived as a normal part of existence, violence as a natural way to solve disputes."
1140,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,"Their chances are small, however, as their arguments rely on polemic, exaggeration and misrepresentation -- in other words, on the same techniques which they accuse Moore of using."
1141,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.4,Moore's film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV.

1149,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,Your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in Moore's movies.
1150,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It is true that Moore's film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive, but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme."
1151,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,It is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades.
1152,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Let's look at some specific criticisms:
1153,0.5,0.5,0.5,"1) The bank scene, listed on your website on a separate page."
1154,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"Critics have stated that this scene was ""staged"", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time."
1155,0.5,0.5,0.5,It is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks.
1156,0.55,0.55,0.55,"In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, linked from your site, an employee claims that the gun would have been ""normally"" picked up at another dealer."
1157,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Dear David Hardy,"
1158,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"It is not explained what ""normally"" is supposed to mean, but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film."
1159,0.4175,0.3325,0.5825,"This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore."
1160,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary.
1161,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,The only thing that Moore compressed is the timeframe.
1162,0.5,0.5,0.5,"According to the same WSJ interview, ""Typically, you're looking at a week to 10 days waiting period."""

1165,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed."
1166,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Moore's detractors have sometimes extended those 7-10 days to several weeks, contradicting the bank's own estimate."
1167,0.5,0.5,0.5,There is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene.
1168,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account.
1169,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate."
1170,0.4375,0.5,0.5,"First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly."
1171,0.5,0.16749999999999998,0.5,The dialogue goes as follows:

1175,0.4375,0.4375,0.625,"Moore is not from Colorado -- his question is generic, not meant to refer specifically to the Lockheed Martin plant in question."
1176,0.4175,0.5825,0.5825,McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized.
1177,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant."
1178,0.5,0.5,0.6,"In response to one Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: ""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited."""

1181,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults."
1182,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"Yes, Moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the LM plant -- but he makes no incorrect statement."
1183,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims."

1185,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,Critics like yourself claim that Moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that Charlton Heston has effectively insulted the victims of the Columbine tragedy by holding a rally in Denver shortly afterwards.
1186,0.4575,0.4575,0.5825,"First, the ""from my cold, dead hands"" part: This is used by Moore as a visual citation to introduce Heston."

1188,0.6,0.55,0.6,"It tells viewers: Aha, this is the person we are talking about."
1189,0.5,0.55,0.55,"It is Moore's way to say: Viewers, meet Charlton Heston, gun nut extraordinaire."
1190,0.4375,0.5,0.5625,"The ""visual of a billboard and a narration"" is viewed by you as evidence that Moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together, when in reality, it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of Heston from his speech in Denver."

1226,0.5,0.5,0.55,The posts I consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to have been composed in 2009.

1232,0.55,0.6,0.6,The fact that I can verify vague memories of events that occurred twenty-five years ago astounds me in a way I sometimes forget the Internet is capable of doing.

1240,0.5,0.55,0.5,Closest I came to that was watching Dale Murphy get tagged out at the plate on what would have been an inside-the-park slam.
1241,0.5,0.5,0.55,"He pitched for the Astros before he came to the Mets, stayed for '85, then he pitched for the Red Sox against the Mets in '86 World Series."

1253,0.25,0.55,0.5,No stinking cricket.
1254,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Yeah, I remember Sambito from the Astros (when the Braves were in the old NL West because it made sense to have a team 3,000 miles from most of their division rivals)."

1261,0.6,0.55,0.5,"In this case, the something in question was watching the wonderfully named Angel Pagan hit an inside-the-park home run and initiate a triple play in the same game."
1262,0.55,0.6,0.55,"It is true that at the end of time, the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers, as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing, but horrendous to watch in person."

1306,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"The unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier, which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes."
1307,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The e-vector (heading) returned from the two polarization-sensitive photodiodes (1, 2) follows a cos2-function."
1308,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae, and to mimic this, Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting “stalks” with which to both interact with other ants (who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae) and take in chemical information."
1309,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These stalks will need to have receptors to measure the n-alkene levels present in another ant’s cuticular hydrocarbons, which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmate’s current task, perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun, causing a different ratio of n-alkanes to n-alkenes and the presence of branched n-alkanes in the hydrocarbon profile (Wagner, et al, 2001, as cited in Gordon & Greene, 2003)."
1310,0.5,0.3325,0.5,"Antie’s stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves, which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate (Arnold, et al, 1996, as cited in Gordon & Mehdiabadi, 1999), receptors to detect food, and receptors for three types of pheromones: those released by successful foragers returning with food, those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest, and those marking piles of trash as midden."
1311,0.5,0.55,0.5,Such a robot would allow for both long-term studies of ant-robot interactions and studies of task-switching in the robots.
1312,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity: foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns (Gordon, 2002), and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest (Gordon & Greene, 2003; Greene & Gordon, 2007)."
1313,0.4575,0.4575,0.5425,"Midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way, since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species (Gordon, 35)."
1314,0.5,0.4,0.55,"For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone."
1315,0.5,0.3325,0.5825,"All of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks, with four of each type of receptor per stalk."
1316,0.5,0.5,0.5,"I propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot (hereafter referred to as Antie) that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest, switching between the foraging, patrolling and midden work behaviors."
1317,0.5,0.5625,0.5,"This technique, described by Ishida, et al (2001), has been shown to improve the chemical plume-tracking abilities of robots."
1318,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,The wires will lead back down through the stalk to the on-board PC.
1319,0.6,0.55,0.55,"Finally, Antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object."
1320,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson, et al (Patent #4,492,949), and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage."
1321,0.5,0.5,0.55,"These will correspond to the muscles of the ant’s mandibles, which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects."
1322,0.55,0.55,0.55,A table of the sensors and their relation to the ant’s sensory system is provided below.

1324,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The red harvester ant lives in hot, dry deserts, building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain."
1325,0.5,0.4,0.55,"The ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds, many of which do not grow in the desert (Gordon, 54), where only a few varieties of small shrubs, small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow (Gordon, 51)."

1328,0.55,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Antie’s motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants.
1329,0.5,0.5,0.5,There will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs.
1330,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers, emulating the grasping power of the ant’s mandibles."
1331,0.55,0.55,0.55,"A third motor will lift and lower the grippers, allowing Antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head."
1332,0.5,0.5,0.5,Three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs.
1333,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"These will be located in different places: the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of Antie, corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths, while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt."
1334,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Other insects and creatures, including other species of ants, are present in the desert, but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals (Gordon, 7-11)."
1335,0.5,0.4,0.5,Almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section.
1336,0.5,0.4375,0.5,The Behavior
1337,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Antie will have a hybrid software architecture: a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors, but many sub-behaviors will operate on a schema basis."
1338,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible, and where appropriate, different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked."
1339,0.5,0.55,0.5,Common Behaviors
1340,0.5625,0.4375,0.6875,"To ease Antie’s on-board memory requirements and processing capabilities (and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand), I propose a few global variables and subroutines."
1341,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode, and are compiled here for ease of reference:"
1342,0.5,0.4,0.5,Background
1343,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests, intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive (Gordon, 11)."
1344,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"Because of this, I will ignore other ant species in the design of Antie, and will not create a fighting behavior."
1345,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism, procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside, in-nest navigation, an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into, object identification and gripping, a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following, and the identification of other ants."
1346,0.55,0.55,0.5,Science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a Turing Test for years.
1347,0.5,0.5,0.55,"For a simple start, the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause Antie to move forward at this speed."
1348,0.5,0.5,0.55,Antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil.
1349,0.5,0.4,0.5,The Ant & the Robot
1350,0.5,0.5,0.5,Ants of this species are of two types: breeding ants (queens and drones) and sterile female workers.
1351,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis, and when combined with the forward cruise function, should cause the robot to move at an angle."
1352,0.5,0.375,0.5625,"In order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside, Antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading, and also how far from the nest it is at its current location."
1353,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by Lambrinos, et al."
1354,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest, and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance."
1355,0.55,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees, positive or negative, and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters."
1356,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal, as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season, which occurs but once per year."
1357,0.5,0.5,0.5,The first function might look something like this:
1358,0.55,0.5,0.55,"In-nest navigation will be a function of the temperature, read by Antie’s thermometer and a light source."
1359,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"To exit, Antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight, and to get deeper, Antie will seek a lower temperature."
1360,0.5,0.5,0.5,The code may look something like this:
1361,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories: brood care, nest maintenance, patrolling and foraging."
1362,0.5,0.4,0.6,"This void function will be called nestEnter(), and will take in no inputs."
1363,0.4575,0.4175,0.5,"To avoid bumping into things (including other ants), Antie be provided with an escape function."
1364,0.5,0.4,0.55,"Each of Antie’s eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount, and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction."
1365,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Regardless, this will be a very simple function."
1366,0.5,0.5,0.6,I will include one example:
1367,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Little is known about brood care, as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest."
1368,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Because this function responds to the sensors on Antie’s around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it, this escape function will not prevent Antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds."
1369,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Before picking objects up, however, Antie will need to identify them."
1370,0.55,0.55,0.6,This object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated.
1371,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell.
1372,0.5,0.125,0.5,The code may look something like this:
1373,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"Nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest, but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest (midden work) occurs close enough to the surface to be observable."
1374,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Once the object has been identified, Antie may grip it and lift it."
1375,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.4,A void function release() will perform this same action in reverse.
1376,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on “antennae” stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past (Webb, 1998), regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones."
1377,0.5,0.5,0.5,"As a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing, a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from Antie’s four sensors on each stalk."
1378,0.5,0.4175,0.5,The differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a “left_IP” or “right_IP.”
1379,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of Braitenberg’s aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book “Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology,” as this was found through a series of experiments by Russell, et al (2003) to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models."
1380,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces, I will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine."
1381,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"Patrolling and foraging, too, occur for the most part outside of the nest, and have therefore been studied extensively (ex., Schafer, et al, 2006; Gordon, et al, 2002; Gordon, 2002; Gordon, 1987)."
1382,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Unfortunately, as of yet, no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds, and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society."
1383,0.5425,0.4575,0.5,Proposal for a Red Harvester Ant Robot: Colony Infiltration and Task Switching
1384,0.5,0.4,0.5,"For the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode, I will refer to these subroutines as trailFollow(), findFood(), and findMidden()."
1385,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,All three are void and take no inputs.
1386,0.5,0.4,0.4,The final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants.
1387,0.5,0.375,0.5,"As harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with non-nestmates, Antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest."
1388,0.5,0.5,0.5,Antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the n-alkene levels.
1389,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this:
1390,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Using these basic common behaviors, more complex behaviors may be coded."
1391,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan, but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony (Gordon, 1996)."
1392,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age (ex., Ingram, et al, 2005) and partially as a function of interactions with other workers (ex., Schafer et al, 2006; Gordon, 2002; Greene & Gordon, 2007)."
1393,0.6,0.6,0.6,"As a result, I will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in."
1394,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Midden work, which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside, will occur first; patrolling, which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside, will occur second; and foraging will be the final behavior."
1395,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"Finally, I will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors."
1396,0.55,0.55,0.55,The midden work behavior will be Antie’s default initial behavior.
1397,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"As previously stated, a midden worker must identify midden, grasp it, and carry it to the surface, depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden."
1398,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,A program encoding this behavior might look like this:
1399,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler, though there is some overlap, particularly with navigational problems."
1400,0.5,0.4,0.55,"The second behavior, patrolling, involves two sub-behaviors: nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
1401,0.5,0.375,0.375,"Nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest, roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes, and reentering the nest."
1402,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"This behavior will be implemented in two parts, with a task-switching algorithm based on age."
1403,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy (Moron, et al, 2007), and that task-switching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages (Ingram, et al, 2005)."
1404,0.5,0.5,0.5,It is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which Antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling.
1405,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In order to perform both of these functions, Antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zig-zag fashion, as harvester ants do (Gordon, 34)."
1406,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory, though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests’ territories (Gordon, 57-60)."
1407,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day, even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths (Gordon, 45)."
1408,0.5,0.5,0.5,The code may look something like this:
1409,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors, nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
1410,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Nest patrollers will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again.
1411,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Trail patrollers will go much further, until food sources are found, and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow."
1412,0.5,0.5,0.5,"An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound, presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit."
1413,0.5,0.5,0.5,A general site of food is all that the patroller need find; the foragers will dig through the sand for the food.
1414,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.5,Code for the patrolling behavior might look like this (note that part is on a schema basis):
1415,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The integers nestpatrol_age and trailpatrol_age will represent the ages at which it is appropriate to switch to these tasks.
1416,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers’ cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers, who may then, upon smelling the returning patroller, be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest."
1417,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"The final behavior, foraging, will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by R."
1418,0.5,0.35,0.5,Andrew Russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume.
1419,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds, and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest."
1420,0.5,0.5,0.5,This algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them.
1421,0.5,0.5,0.5,It would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counter-clockwise.
1422,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The code for this, adapted from Russell’s paper, might look like this:"
1423,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Foragers will follow trails marked by patrollers to their conclusion before collecting food to bring back to the nest, even if more tantalizing food presents itself in their path (Gordon, 47)."
1424,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"To address this, a strict subsumption hierarchy will make sure that the foragers do not stop to collect food too soon."
1425,0.5,0.4,0.55,The code might look like this:
1426,0.5,0.55,0.5,"An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest, wander around searching for food sources, identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is."
1427,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Of course, what makes Antie an innovative robot is the task-switching between these larger behaviors."
1428,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Because the midden work behavior is Antie’s initial default behavior, I will not address task switching to midden work."
1429,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants, and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in Antie’s CPU that will count its “age” since last boot."
1430,0.5,0.5,0.55,"To remind the reader, this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited task-switching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling."
1431,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,"Infiltrating insect societies, however, is much simpler."
1432,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow (Gordon, 33-34; Holldobler et al, 1990, as cited in Webb, 1998)."
1433,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"According to Schafer’s, et al. model of forager activation, every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit, a fraction (modeled at 0.0035) of inactive foragers joins the queue."
1434,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"For the purposes of modeling Antie, I will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent, irreversible and partly a function of age, with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers."
1435,0.5625,0.5625,0.625,The code to model this task-switching might look something like this:
1436,0.5,0.5,0.5,Conclusion
1437,0.55,0.6,0.5,"Antie will be a fully autonomous, situated and embodied agent, infiltrating a red harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants’ behaviors and their task-switching thresholds, but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary."
1438,0.5,0.55,0.55,"In addition to following these trails to the food, foragers must also be able to identify food, grasp it and carry it back to the nest."
1439,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers, and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as for the obvious practical applications of robot swarms, such as on the battlefield and standard building maintenance."
1440,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks (as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task), walk, navigate both within and outside of the nest, and of course switch tasks at appropriate times."
1441,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees, ants and cockroaches, and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already (Halloy et al, 2007)."
1442,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Agent
1443,0.5,0.5,0.5,Chassis
1444,0.6,0.6,0.6,Antie will be implemented on a tiny Road Warrior robotic system.
1445,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Behaviors will be coded in Interactive C, for which some pseudocode is included."
1446,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Sensors will include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors."
1447,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Antie be a circular robot, no more than 1cm in diameter (the length of a red harvester ant), with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization."
1448,0.5,0.5,0.625,A gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs.
1449,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors, sonar detectors and chemical emitters, including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging."
1450,0.5,0.5,0.5,These sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as Antie determines that they are getting depleted.
1451,0.55,0.55,0.55,Antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance.
1452,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"For the purposes of this proposal, I will assume that Antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day."
1453,0.5,0.5,0.6,A rudimentary blueprint of Antie is attached.
1454,0.5,0.5,0.5,Sensors
1455,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In order to inform itself about its environment, Antie will need a number of sensors."
1456,0.5,0.375,0.5,"In an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible, these sensors include a thermometer, photoreceptors, bump sensors and sonar, a polarization compass, and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae."
1457,0.5,0.5,0.5,"On its front grippers, Antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure."
1458,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,The locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function.
1459,0.5,0.5,0.6,"The thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way, and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees Celsius."
1460,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees Celsius (Gordon, 9), and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable in-nest navigation."
1461,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,Antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ant’s eyes.
1462,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night: the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night (Gordon, 5)."
1463,0.5,0.5,0.5,"No robot has yet been constructed, however, that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species Pogonomyrmex barbatus; nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them."
1464,0.5,0.5,0.5,The bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around Antie to keep it from colliding with other objects.
1465,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"The sonar will correspond to the ant’s limited optical object detection ability, and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions."
1466,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and -45 degrees from the center front of Antie, respectively, that will orient Antie towards a desired polarization pattern."
1467,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"These sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants’ eyes sensitive to polarized light, and research has shown that many insects, including ants, do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer (Labhart, et al, 2002)."
1468,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by Lambrinos, Moller, Labhart, Pfeifer and Wehner in 2000, consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers."
1469,0.5,0.375,0.5,"The difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to Antie, who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest: Upon each exit from the nest, Antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky, and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later."
1470,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"This should be sufficient to return Antie to the nest, given the accuracy achieved by Lambrinos, et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning."
1471,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172)."
1472,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,Illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the Mayan language itself: those who speak Spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak Mayan alone (England 2003: 733).
1473,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key."
1474,0.5,0.5,0.5,This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.
1475,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Within the pan-Mayan movement, there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity: some view the reduction of their language to the status of ""dialect"" devalues their unique identity and place in the Mayan world; however, despite differences over standardization, the pan-Mayan movement itself is largely cohesive."
1476,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"In contrast, Colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued, but serves to split the population, both between groups and within groups themselves."
1477,0.55,0.55,0.55,"An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single “ethnic group”, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4)."
1478,0.5,0.55,0.55,Language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant Western culture.
1479,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Indigenous cosmology, or “cosmovision”, is difficult to translate into Romanticized languages; it maintains a concept of culture, defined as “the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with Nature” (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58) and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with Western modes of thought."
1480,0.5,0.5,0.5,The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with.
1481,0.5625,0.625,0.5,"Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia."
1482,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Customary law in Colombia contrasts with Western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships: tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony, crimes are viewed as imbalances in the community's harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime, but may have influenced the accused to do so."
1483,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity
1484,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"When a punishment - often public and corporal in nature - is carried out, the group feels the effects as a whole."
1485,0.4575,0.4175,0.4575,"Shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence, sharing in their ordeal."
1486,0.5,0.5,0.5,"(Rappaport 2005) Once punishments are completed, the criminal is seen as rehabilitated, having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order, and is welcomed back into the community (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 61, Rappaport 2005: 97)."
1487,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision."
1488,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The translation of the Colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms, as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution, but to recapture its spirit in a native, rather than Western discourse (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 58-59)."
1489,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"This provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the Spanish Colombian culture, and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing (Rappaport 2005: 93, 236)."
1490,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries."
1491,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.44999999999999996,The Guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature; Mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten (Rappaport 2005: 165).
1492,0.5,0.35,0.5,This attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use.
1493,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Difficulties arise, however, as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and Spanish develop."
1494,0.5,0.5,0.625,"In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new."
1495,0.5,0.4,0.55,"The authenticity of the modern Nasa, who are often metropolitan Spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots, is brought into question by the traditional, who speak Nasa Yuwe and lead a rural existence(Rappaport 2005)."
1496,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so."
1497,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"A further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic “Indianness”, both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside Spanish culture."
1498,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85)."
1499,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages."
1500,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself."
1501,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.
1502,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5)."
1503,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom."
1504,0.5,0.5,0.5,"An emphasis on preserving, rather than practicing, native culture arises: indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a day-to-day basis (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 66-67)."
1505,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed.
1506,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"In Guatemala, they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress; the pan-Mayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the Mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law."
1507,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8)."
1508,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status, indigenous peoples in Colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws (Jackson 1995: 5)."
1509,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Conflicts arise due to internal differences and the ever-persist problem of defining indigenous identity and authenticity in a pluralistic linguistic environment.

1511,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,The effects of Spanish colonialism are both far-reaching and deeply embedded in both countries.
1512,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"This was in turn replaced by the repartimento; the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the Spanish, providing labor and taxes as demanded."
1513,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others."
1514,0.4,0.55,0.5,"In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8). Indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers."
1515,0.5,0.375,0.375,The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century.
1516,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture."
1517,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7)."
1518,0.4,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"A truce established between the Liberals and Conservatives failed to meet the demands of the Communists, who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response."
1519,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples."
1520,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those “outside” them, those who do not belong."
1521,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"This is similar to the situation of Guatemala: the government felt it needed to battle communism, an “armed and dangerous menace within”, plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s (Warren 1993: 25)."
1522,0.35,0.5,0.55,"This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population. In both counties, guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples; in many cases there were coalitions, but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote, inaccessible villages as hideouts."
1523,0.3325,0.5425,0.5825,"In Guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed, 200,000 Mayans were killed, and over 1 million more were displaced."
1524,0.5,0.5,0.5,The main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord (Warren 2002: 157-158).
1525,0.5,0.5,0.55,The growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements.
1526,0.5,0.5,0.5,"By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82)."
1527,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Central to these was the question of indigenous identity:
1528,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Pan-Mayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the Mayan language; despite local dialectical differences, it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse Mayan people."
1529,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739)."
1530,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"Pan-Mayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity; it largely avoids specifically political overtones, instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging Mayan culture (England 2003: 734)."
1531,0.5,0.3325,0.5825,"The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool."
1532,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,It therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse .
1533,0.55,0.55,0.55,"The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181)."
1534,0.375,0.625,0.625,"A main concern among pan-Mayanists is the reversal of the long-seated inferiority complex of the Mayan people; despite their position as majority within the Guatemalan population, they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society."
1535,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices."
1536,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"This results in part from the ingrained influences of Spanish colonialism: Spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility, whereas Maya is seen as backward and inferior."
1537,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736)."
1538,0.5,0.5,0.5,By doing so they hope to inculcate among the Mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of Spanish superiority.
1539,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language."
1540,0.5,0.375,0.375,"Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85)."
1541,0.5,0.5,0.625,One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.
1542,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The CRIC, which focuses on language development and renewal, is primarily representative of the Nasa peoples (Jackson 2003: 82)."
1543,0.4175,0.5,0.4175,"It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84)."
1544,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Whereas the Mayanists benefit from a single main identity, those of Colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups (Jackson 2002: 109)."
1545,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).
1546,0.6,0.5,0.6,"This reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities, both from the Spanish Colombian population and each other."
1547,0.5825,0.5,0.5,"The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry."
1548,0.4,0.55,0.55,"In the 1990s the rhetoric of ""cultural diversity"" was picked up the Colombian media, and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public, thereby cementing its place in Colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole."
1549,0.5,0.3325,0.5825,"A major success in the Colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991, which includes a section on indigenous rights, as the Congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57)."
1550,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,Central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty.
1551,0.65,0.6,0.6,"While the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups, it is now used to support them: resguardos, or communally owned plots of land, are granted to communities."
1552,0.5,0.4,0.5,"They are ruled by the cabildo, local governing boards formed of community leaders (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 51-52)."
1553,0.5,0.5,0.5,The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity:
1554,0.5,0.5,0.55,"no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era."
1555,0.5,0.5,0.5,In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers.
1556,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"The oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the Colombian government to codify law, and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature (Gow and Rappaport 2002: 57-58)."
1557,0.35,0.55,0.44999999999999996,The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999.
1558,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).
1559,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"The terrorists could strike any time they choose, through any of the numerous loopholes so well reported in our media."
1560,0.5,0.55,0.5,"This website and everything on it is in the Public Domain, so you may use it freely, even without attribution."
1561,0.4,0.6,0.55,"But they have chosen not to attack, perhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the 9/11 attacks, so they do not appear to be losing strength."
1562,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,What could be more spectacular than the 9/11 attacks?
1563,0.4,0.8,0.65,Nuclear!
1564,0.4,0.65,0.4,Or massive bio-chemical attack!
1565,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,And I think this is what they are waiting for.
1566,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.4,"All of our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing small-time casual attacks, but they cannot stop a serious planned attack, any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious robber who really wants to get into your house."
1567,0.5,0.5,0.4,"So the Bush administration can keep claiming that we are safer now, under their policies."
1568,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"But this claim is merely feel-good propaganda, intended to keep the neo-cons in power."
1569,0.35,0.6,0.65,It cannot withstand clear-headed scrutiny.
1570,0.15000000000000002,0.5,0.5,"The fact is, Bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism, much less defeat it."
1571,0.2,0.65,0.5,"By trying to ""stamp out"" terrorism by killing terrorists, Bush and Israel have made things infinitely worse for us: more dangerous, not safer."
1572,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"And proof that Bush has failed may come at any moment, explosively, with one big successful attack here in the USA."

1575,0.30000000000000004,0.65,0.44999999999999996,WHAT IS TERRORISM?
1576,0.5,0.55,0.5,"TERRORISM is ""the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective."
1577,0.25,0.5,0.6,"We believe that any terrorist act is a crime against humanity and against the will of God, because it deliberately intends to injure and kill innocent people."
1578,0.25,0.6,0.5,"Three years have now gone by since the September 11th attacks in 2001, and terrorism is a far greater threat to us now than it was then."
1579,0.35,0.65,0.65,NEUTRALIZING TERRORISM
1580,0.5,0.6,0.65,Our purpose here is to NEUTRALIZE TERRORISM by removing the motivation for it.
1581,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"Without motivation, terrorism will quickly die down, like a plant without water."
1582,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"We completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force, because brute force radicalizes the moderates, and they then join the terrorists."
1583,0.5,0.5,0.4,"Brute force has failed in Palestine, and it is failing in Iraq."
1584,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.65,"We try to be even-handed in opposing all terrorism, although we recognize that the greatest terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical Muslims who falsely believe that Allah approves of their criminal behavior against Israel, The United States, Russia, India, the Philippines, Australia, and others whom they falsely believe to be ""waging war against Allah."
1585,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.5,"And the second-greatest terrorist threat comes from several countries, mainly Israel, who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves, claiming ""self-defense,"" as they desperately try to prevent further attacks by radical Muslims."
1586,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"In all of these cases above, if the radical Muslims would cease their attacks, all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end."

1588,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Beyond these two sources, there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world, with the possible exception of localized disputes such as in Northern Ireland and occasional domestic episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups."
1589,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.4,"The number and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically, as has the number of active terrorists."
1590,0.4,0.55,0.55,The moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous.
1591,0.25,0.8,0.8,They need to be identified and attacked.
1592,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"If the terrorist loses faith in the righteousness of his acts, he is less likely to perform them."

1597,0.5,0.55,0.55,"If we eliminate the legitimate grievances, we have eliminated much of the motivation."
1598,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"Is this ""negotiating with terrorists"" or ""trying to appease the terrorists,"" as some Israeli/NeoCons would try to say?"
1599,0.55,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"It is simply recognizing the realities of human motivation, right or wrong."

1693,0.4,0.55,0.5,"As a person who cares about animals, you’re probably anxious to know what happened to Astro."
1694,0.4,0.5,0.6,A neighbor reported Astro’s plight to the ASPCA and our Humane Law Enforcement officers went to investigate.
1695,0.4,0.5,0.4,"When our officers arrived, Astro was too weak to even stand up."
1696,0.4375,0.4375,0.4375,"The officers knelt down slowly, speaking gently to the emaciated dog."
1697,0.5,0.5,0.5,Then they saw it.
1698,0.625,0.5625,0.4375,Astro was wagging his tail.
1699,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.35,He was barely moving.
1700,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"but yes -- the poor, sick dog was saying."
1701,0.7,0.75,0.55,"“Welcome, friends!”"
1702,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.55,The officers brought Astro to the ASPCA’s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital.
1703,0.375,0.4375,0.4375,The dog weighted only 45 pounds -- less than half of what a dog his size should weigh -- and he had several infections.
1704,0.6,0.6,0.5,"But with first-rate medical attention and tender care from ASPCA staff, he slowly got well again."
1705,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Stories like Astro’s are all too common.
1706,0.2,0.55,0.55,"Every day, the ASPCA gets reports of animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect."
1707,0.35,0.6,0.6,"Every day, our officers rescue animals like Sammy, a 10-month-old kitten who was deliberately thrown from a high-rise window by teenagers."
1708,0.55,0.65,0.6,"In a world where cruelty is common, animals like Sammy and Astro desperately need friends like you."
1709,0.5,0.4,0.5,That is why I have written to you -- to ask you to support the ASPCA today.
1710,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Our vital anti-cruelty efforts are just part of the ASPCA mission. We also find loving adoptive homes for rescued animals ... provide first-rate veterinary care through our Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital ... offer low-cost spay and neuter programs for cats and dogs ... reach out to children, teachers, and parents through our Education Programs."
1711,0.4,0.4,0.5,His belly was empty.
1712,0.16749999999999998,0.5,0.4175,So empty it hurt.

1715,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,At least Astro could drink water from a puddle near the stake he was chained to.
1716,0.55,0.5,0.55,"Since the ASPCA was founded in 1866 as America’ s first humane society, ending cruelty has been our primary goal."
1717,0.375,0.5825,0.4175,"Today, over 130 years later, the scope of the problem is greater than ever."

1760,0.375,0.375,0.5625,"Let me tell you exactly what’s at stake ... and how this could set a dangerous precedent: First of all, you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act’s prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm."
1761,0.3325,0.6675,0.5,Just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds -- among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slow-acting poison spread in fields miles away.
1762,0.4575,0.5,0.5425,"You see, the USDA found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities."
1763,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.6,So they applied for the right to spread poison as Dart of a “scientific experiment” -- to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss.
1764,0.5,0.4175,0.5,“scientific experiment”
1765,0.55,0.6,0.55,Can you believe it?
1766,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,The USDA wants to conduct an “experiment” that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds.
1767,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,“experiment”
1768,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.55,And if the death of two million birds doesn’t “prove” their theory -- and show a reduction in crop loss -- they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year!
1769,0.5,0.5,0.55,“prove”
1770,0.5,0.4375,0.625,"It’s time to tell the USDA, in no uncertain terms:"
1771,0.3125,0.625,0.625,“YOU WILL NOT CONDUCT MASSIVE BIRD KILLS TO BENEFIT A HANDFUL OF SPECIAL INTERESTS!”
1772,0.4,0.6,0.5,"Because the USDA’s slow-acting pesticide takes three days to kill, its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields, before falling to the ground."
1773,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Meanwhile,blackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison."
1774,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"We’ve noted the presence of 68 other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison-baited areas ... including the Bobolink, Grasshopper Sparrow, Harris’ Sparrow and Le Conte’s Sparrow."
1775,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In all, nine birds on the Federal threatened or endangered lists and 11 birds on Audubon’s WatchList of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields."
1776,0.5625,0.5625,0.625,"Here’s what I need you to do, to make sure we prevail: First, I need you to sign and return your Petition to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture."
1777,0.5,0.55,0.5,"I’ll forward your Petition, along with those from thousands of other Audubon members and supporters, urging the USDA to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds ... in favor of alternative, benign methods of protecting sunflower crops."
1778,0.65,0.75,0.65,I can assure you that thousands of Audubon Petitions can make a difference -- just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago!
1779,0.5,0.5825,0.5825,But today’s battle is one we must win ... to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment.
1780,0.5,0.55,0.55,"That’s why I hope you’ll also agree to help even more by making a tax-deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of Audubon’s vital conservation work to protect birds, other wildlife and habitat."
1781,0.2,0.5,0.5,And who plans to commit such a mass bird killing?

1854,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,”"
1855,0.5,0.4,0.6,"Wilson, 173."
1856,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.65,but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition.
1857,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Exposition
1858,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Although the motivic relationship between the Introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition, nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears."
1859,0.55,0.4,0.5,Harmonic Structure and Form
1860,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,The drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over.
1861,0.5,0.5,0.5,"As mentioned, the first theme, the beginning of which is reproduced in Example 8, contains two head motives: the first is the tritone-spanning ascent that appears in the first measure, and the second is an iteration of the interval cell (+5, -2, +5) that appears in the second through third measures."
1862,0.5,0.5,0.5,Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form.”
1863,0.5,0.375,0.5,"While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter, the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation."
1864,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings."
1865,0.5,0.5,0.5,"As Example 10 shows, the chords are more-or-less in duple meter (4/8 and 2/8) with one “hiccup” occurring in the 5/8 measure."
1866,0.5,0.4175,0.5,This is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody (with its own “hiccups” occurring in the written 2/8 measures).
1867,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.65,"As we will later see, this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation."
1868,0.5,0.5,0.55,"While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order."
1869,0.5,0.4,0.55,"We have already mentioned that the first theme group is in F—this is made clear from the onset, both in the melodic line and by the F minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77."
1870,0.5,0.5,0.55,"While the material occasionally departs from this F in measures 76-94, these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged F."
1871,0.5,0.5,0.5,"E♭ is the tonal center for measures 95-134, although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131."
1872,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Measures 95-130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from C to E♭, where E♭ is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass."
1873,0.5,0.4,0.5,Example 11 illustrates this structure.
1874,0.5,0.375,0.375,"Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass, C♯ (D♭) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme."
1875,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"The trombone motive in measures 134-141, shown in Example 12, is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development, although its importance is downplayed here."
1876,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Note that the initial G♯ is a pickup to the section in C♯, which fills in the whole-tone descent from E♭ to C♯ with the intervening fourth."
1877,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of G♯-C♯-B-E (with the addition of some passing tones), in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths."
1878,0.5,0.5,0.55,Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition.
1879,0.5,0.5,0.5,"While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context."
1880,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all."
1881,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The passage from measures 85-89 is centered on E♭ (and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step), but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function."
1882,0.5,0.5,0.5,"However, as previously mentioned, C acts as a “fake” dominant that in measures 149-155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to B, the “true” dominant."
1883,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge."
1884,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple, which is in stark contrast to the first theme."
1885,0.5,0.5,0.5,B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it.
1886,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,The “backwards” recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates.
1887,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Measures 192-197 are in E♭, with the bass notes in the harp, and measures 198-209 are in D♭."
1888,0.5,0.4,0.5,A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth.
1889,0.5,0.4,0.5,The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209.
1890,0.5,0.35,0.6,"Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged."
1891,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Paul Wilson points out that “[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”"
1892,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“[i]n substituting for F within an analogous structure, B receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement.”"
1893,0.5,0.5,0.55,"In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant."
1894,0.5425,0.4175,0.5,The Development
1895,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"As Paul Wilson states, the development “is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”; the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified, and tonalities other than those expected arise."
1896,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“is, for Bartók’s music, developmental in a relatively conventional way”"
1897,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The only slight abnormality, though it is certainly not unheard of even in classical-period sonata movements, is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development."
1898,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”"
1899,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],”"
1900,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Before beginning an analysis of any piece by Béla Bartók, one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used."
1901,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Also see Bartók’s comments on that (Bartók, 414)."
1902,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Wilson, 182."
1903,0.5,0.4175,0.6675,"there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed."
1904,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Furthermore, this section, being the middle section of the movement, upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme."
1905,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The first section of the development, measures 231-271, begins with a big D-minor chord which immediately establishes D as the tonal center for the section."
1906,0.5,0.5,0.5,Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction.
1907,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The passage beginning at measure 248, shown in Example 13, can be considered to be the “theme” of this section, and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme."
1908,0.5,0.5,0.55,This motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section.
1909,0.5,0.4,0.55,"While Wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261-264 as 6-Z50 ([014679]), identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence (+5, -2, +5) from the original motive."
1910,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"This section returns to the calm simplicity (and tempo) of the second section, though apart from affect there are no references to that section."
1911,0.5,0.5625,0.625,"Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303."
1912,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"The arrival at C♯ was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development (Example 15), which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to C♯."
1913,0.5,0.55,0.5,"As the example shows, the development section is divided into three subsections; the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group, and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition."
1914,0.5,0.55,0.55,"The third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in Example 12, transposed to begin on F, and turns it into a fugato sequence, reproduced in Example 17."
1915,0.5,0.4175,0.5,The tonal center B♭ is established immediately in measures 316-318 by the strong V-I chord progression (Example 16).
1916,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,The resultant set is the pentatonic set F-B♭-E♭-A♭-D♭; the entire passage shown in Example 17 remains within this set.
1917,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center)."
1918,0.5,0.375,0.625,"The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C."
1919,0.5,0.375,0.5,"The following section (measures 363-389) especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set, so much so that B♭ is obscured as tonal center which allows A♭ to emerge as the goal tone of this section—only to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the A that begins the recapitulation."
1920,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Both B♭ and A♭ are chromatic neighbors to A, which intensifies the arrival on A, and brings out the fact that the appearance of A continues the large-scale whole-tone descent that has been left stranded on B for the entire development section."
1921,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric."
1922,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Recapitulation
1923,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified."
1924,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G."
1925,0.55,0.55,0.6,"Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467."
1926,0.55,0.5,0.5,"E and F♯ are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme (measures 456-487) which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to F, which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the much-anticipated recapitulation of the first theme."
1927,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences."
1928,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"In the recapitulation of this theme, shown in Example 19, the first chord is an F-major chord, and the A♭ is replaced by A♮ in the melody."
1929,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation."
1930,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different."
1931,0.55,0.5,0.55,"In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes."
1932,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"In other words, the piece, in becoming more regular, is beginning to drive towards the finish—because of the formal structure, the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement."
1933,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Indeed, this section has the feel of a Coda to it—it is much shorter than any other major section or subsection, and the tonic harmony is active throughout."
1934,0.5,0.4,0.5,"See Wilson, 168-170."
1935,0.55,0.55,0.55,"While we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind, and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions, by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work."
1936,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum."
1937,0.5,0.5,0.5,To do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the Concerto for Orchestra.
1938,0.5425,0.4575,0.5,It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why.
1939,0.5,0.5,0.5,References
1940,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively."
1941,0.55,0.5,0.5,"While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure."
1942,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Bartók’s music, although it is often difficult to call completely tonal, never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure."
1943,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,"To begin with, the movement is in F."
1944,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"When we say “in F,” we do not imply F major (or minor, for that matter)—the major/minor tonal system in general does not apply to this piece—but rather that the pitch-class F is the tonal center of the movement, and acts analogously to the tonic in a Mozartian sonata movement."
1945,0.5,0.3325,0.5825,Tonal Structure and Form in Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (I)
1946,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"Using this interpretation, we can map out the local tonics (tonal centers) used throughout the movement, as shown in Example 2."
1947,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In this example, the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece (Introduction–Exposition–Development­–Recapitulation)—so we can immediately see that the tonic F is not established until the exposition begins."
1948,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg."
1949,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The middle pitch of the descent, B, acts as the “dominant” to F, based on its symmetrical division of the whole-tone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in B in the exposition."
1950,0.4,0.4,0.65,"This remains true even with one of his last compositions, the Concerto for Orchestra, written two years before his death in 1943."
1951,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Bartók has often applied a tonic-dominant relationship to a pitch-class and its tritone partner, and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet."
1952,0.5,0.5,0.5,"See Bartók, 414-415."
1953,0.5,0.5,0.55,"In this particular movement, Bartók feigns moving to the tonal dominant, C, for the second theme before reinterpreting C as a chromatic passing tone between D♭ and B—this and other subtleties shown in Example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections."
1954,0.5,0.4175,0.5,Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure.
1955,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"The graph in Example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis; while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements, it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced, this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper."
1956,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Introduction
1957,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"As Paul Wilson points out, the title “Introduzione” given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures."
1958,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement."
1959,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece."
1960,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center."
1961,0.5,0.5,0.55,"The pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitch-class set, and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale."
1962,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself."
1963,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"The perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement, and its importance is immediately evident in the Introduction with the opening bass motive."
1964,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,"Furthermore, the following two instances of this opening motive, shown in Examples 4 and 5, remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth, and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set."
1965,0.55,0.4,0.55,"Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths."
1966,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth; the set created is a ten-note set derived by stacking fourths.
1967,0.5,0.5,0.55,If we begin from the final D♯ and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach C we obtain the entire set presented in this example.
1968,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Each note is either approached or left (or both) by a fourth, and the structural motion is from F♯ to D♯."
1969,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"As previously mentioned, this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a whole-tone descent from F to F."
1970,0.5,0.5,0.55,So the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a (usually ascending) perfect fourth.
1971,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"We can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths; indeed, the structural whole-tone descent is often “filled in” with the intervening fourth."
1972,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,We will also examine to what degree a “tonal” reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where Bartók strays from common-practice compositional techniques.
1973,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2."
1974,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Each time the motion in Examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths, the same sequence of intervals occurs: two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second (-5, +2, -5); each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples."
1975,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"This sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition, shown in measures 2-3 of Example 8."
1976,0.5,0.5,0.5,"So although there is no thematic relation between the Introduction and the main sections of the movement, within the first 29 measures we can already see structural, harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole."
1977,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor."
1978,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 51-57 however; while there is no clear tonal center for this section, G appears in the outer voices in measure 51, although the harmonic material is reminiscent of C minor."
1979,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"The concluding motive of this section in the violins (the bracketed sections of Example 6), as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff."
1980,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"(Example 7), are related to the first head motive of the first theme, which is shown in the first measure of Example 8."
1981,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.65,"All three of these motives span a tritone, which as mentioned is the “dominant” relationship in this movement."
1982,0.5,0.5,0.6675,Because of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonize
1983,0.6,0.55,0.65,For this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces.
1984,0.5,0.4,0.5,Why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our space?
1985,0.5,0.5,0.5825,The white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them.
1986,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,It stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours of the space.
1987,0.5625,0.5,0.5625,"“In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing, all the details of the form and color of the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background…In this a form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in “closed” spaces”"
1988,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"In the 19th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white, while men dressed in black (Wigley)."
1989,0.5,0.5,0.5,What exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered non-colors?
1990,0.4175,0.5,0.3325,"These distinctions proved a certain rational order, only attained by those able to afford of it."
1991,0.5,0.5,0.55,"White walls, white clothing, they both require much more maintenance than something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors."
1992,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury, and leisure."
1993,0.55,0.55,0.55,"White clothing proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work, for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white, while men who were the ones to go out and work wore black, for black did in fact hide stains."
1994,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint."
1995,0.5425,0.4575,0.5,"“Pure white was de rigueur, partly because of its exciting novelty, partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture, and pointed the contrast between it and surrounding nature”"
1996,0.6,0.65,0.6,The use of white was proof that man had conquered nature.
1997,0.5,0.5825,0.5825,"Ever since the dawn of man, human society has evolved in ways which attempt to ultimately control nature."
1998,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Furthermore, with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes."
1999,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Now, anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them."
2000,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Thus said, the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low."
2001,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"“In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie, there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color, with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray”"
2002,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Seeing as color is something of the natural world, age old and archaic, washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above the physical world."
2003,0.5,0.5,0.5,Another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the Victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness.
2004,0.5,0.4,0.55,"Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so."
2005,0.5,0.5,0.5,Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white.
2006,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Photography took over as a means of portraiture for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to color the photographs, for the most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more “natural”."
2007,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,"Above all, it is believed that the expanse of literacy and the printed word, mainly the newspaper, had a profound effect in influencing the choice of black and white."
2008,0.55,0.55,0.55,"“This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform, a world in “black and white”"
2009,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"This led to the idea of writing = rationality = production that confined images, especially images in color, to the emerging field of “art”, which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive, while it assigned to the two-toned and orderly world of printed paper the role of a daily guide to existence”"
2010,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“Intelligent beings have a language represented by articulate sounds; organized beings, like all animals and vegetables, express themselves by cries or forms, contour or carriage."
2011,0.5825,0.5,0.5825,Black and white became a symbol for the superiority of man’s intellect and technology.
2012,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"This then translated down into the world of fashion, as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space."
2013,0.5425,0.4575,0.5425,"Seeing as since the time of Aristotle, form was valued over that of color, the arts which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form."
2014,0.6,0.55,0.55,“Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy”
2015,0.5825,0.5,0.5,In order to meet the demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the attention of consumers.
2016,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it reproduced it d infinitum.
2017,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Greenberg continues by saying, “Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility."
2018,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas.
2019,0.35,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations.
2020,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same."
2021,0.4,0.55,0.5,Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money -- not even their time”.
2022,0.5,0.4,0.55,With the advent of kitsch came a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms.
2023,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Avant guard at the time was considered to be true art, while this kitsch was simply pure imitation."
2024,0.5,0.5,0.6,Inorganic nature has only the language of color.
2025,0.5,0.5,0.6,"Thus said, this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious, high art, while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes."
2026,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Of course during the early stages of color film and photography, the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images."
2027,0.5,0.55,0.5,For the play of light and form was key in demonstrating the true art form.
2028,0.55,0.5,0.5,"It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or emerald… color, then, is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature, while drawing becomes the medium of expression, more and more dominant, the higher we rise in the scale of being”"
2029,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"That was what made up the essence of an image, not the artificial, or superficial filling in of form with color."
2030,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality.
2031,0.5,0.5,0.55,Still though black and white is seen as something of a more sober tradition.
2032,0.55,0.5,0.5,These non colors allow for the appreciation of color.
2033,0.5,0.5,0.5,"When something is black and white, it allows the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen."
2034,0.5,0.5,0.6,It is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process.
2035,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,"Whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color, the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years."
2036,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color, but perhaps it is human instinct, to want to surpass and rebel against generations before, so possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration."
2037,0.5,0.5,0.35,Thus is the ebb and flow of life.
2038,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The world is made up of a myriad of colors. color gives distinction to our life, it gives flavor and meaning."
2039,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"In the Far East, reaching a state of colorless-ness is associated with the highest state of spiritual being, the state of Zen."
2040,0.5,0.5,0.5625,What is typical of this sort of ascetism is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal.
2041,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,This is apparent through Japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both China and Japan.
2042,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"For them, reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form."
2043,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the artist had reached within himself, it was a means of reducing down to the essence of a thing."
2044,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In the Elimination of color in the Far East, Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color."
2045,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"“This artistic acestism, i.e., the suppression of externals and the reduction of all colors to black and white, manifests its real aesthetic function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and their subtle hues."
2046,0.55,0.5,0.55,What would our lives be without color?
2047,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"At the same time in our modern society, color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space."
2048,0.5,0.5,0.5,For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as non-colors.
2049,0.5,0.55,0.55,It is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no longer present.
2050,0.5,0.5,0.5,It is up to the mind to fill in the blank space.
2051,0.5825,0.5425,0.5825,Without color one could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space.
2052,0.5,0.4375,0.4375,"“That is to say, under the total absence of color, there is a vague reminiscence of all colors that have been “killed”"
2053,0.6,0.55,0.5,Black and white are the consummation of all colors into one.
2054,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,“Black is life; it is the infinite possibility of expression and development. Black here is not sheer black.
2055,0.5,0.35,0.55,"For in it’s negation of all colors, all colors are positively affirmed”"
2056,0.55,0.55,0.5,It is through these means that one finds the essence in a thing.
2057,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In Western society, this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of generations past."
2058,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the 18th century.
2059,0.5425,0.4575,0.5425,"Society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life, representing modernity."
2060,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting and in art, has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch."
2061,0.5,0.375,0.5625,"“The predominance of color at the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute, of fleeting appearance over permanent form, of physical impression over the empire of the soul”"
2062,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"color rests on the surface of an object, it is superficial, cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that thing."
2063,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,color is associated with the Fall from Grace.
2064,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It deals with the body, emotions, not the intellect."
2065,0.5,0.5,0.5,It strays from reason in the way which it consumes and manipulates life.
2066,0.55,0.6,0.55,"For [Charles Blanc] color also represents a kind of ruination. color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization, the nobility of the human spirit, slowly, heroically, has lifted itself – but back into which it could always slide"
2067,0.6,0.55,0.55,"It is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire, and to desire is to lose control over oneself."
2068,0.55,0.6,0.6,We went from times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence.
2069,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Thus, began the cult of the black and white."
2070,0.6,0.4,0.55,"“WHITE is the spiritual color of our times, the clearness which directs all out actions."
2071,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It is neither grey white, nor vory white, but pure white."
2072,0.5,0.5,0.55,"WHITE is the color of modern times, the color which dissipates a whole era; our era is perfection, purity, certitude."
2073,0.55,0.5,0.6,"We have superceded both the ‘brown’ of decadence and classiscm and the ‘blue’ of divisionism, the cult of the blue ky, the gods with green beards and the spectrum."
2074,0.5,0.5825,0.5825,WHITE pure white.
2075,0.5,0.5,0.5,For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of colors.
2076,0.5,0.4,0.5,Abolishing color means controlling color.
2077,0.55,0.55,0.5,"“The white surface exposes color, presents it for disciplining."
2078,0.5,0.5,0.55,It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames.
2079,0.5,0.55,0.55,"But before that, it keeps an eye on itself, watching its freshly laundered and neatly folded fabric for the stain of color”"
2080,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"colorlessness is not natural, and thus proves man’s superiority over this world."
2081,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"On the other hand, we need color in order to distinguish black and white."

2103,0.5,0.5,0.5,We discussed the foundations: the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma; the four noble truths; karma; defilements; the six perfections.
2104,0.5,0.5,0.5,"When we talked about the giving, and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient beings (in the form of material items, kind words, protection, and so on), Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha, and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat."

2159,0.5,0.4,0.5,I'm not one to make New Year's resolutions.
2160,0.5,0.4,0.5,"In the paper, ""self-control"" is used to mean a sense of willpower."
2161,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of self-control, noting that the amount of self-control a person has can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource, and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed (the amount of self-control a person has can change over time, or not)."
2162,0.55,0.6,0.5,"I mean, sure, I could take my pick of popular New Year's resolutions ; I could decide, on the first day of the new year, that this year, I'll start exercising more and eating better, or that I'll spend more time with my family and friends, or that I'll learn a new skill."
2163,0.5,0.55,0.5,An important premise to note here is the idea that the probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained.
2164,0.55,0.4,0.55,"So if you think you'll be able to achieve a goal, you're more likely to set it."
2165,0.5,0.5,0.5,"If you believe self-control is malleable but limited, you'll set fewer goals."
2166,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani also discuss self-efficacy: belief in one's capabilities, the perceived ability to carry out a desired action."
2167,0.5,0.55,0.55,"They propose that people with high self-efficacy--people who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort, and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistence--will achieve more of their goals than people with low self-efficacy, who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability, and thus may simply give up."
2168,0.5,0.5,0.5,The studies
2169,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Each passage contained two paragraphs; the first discussed self-control either as limited or as unlimited, and the second discussed self-control as either malleable or fixed."
2170,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The participants then answered questions about their belief in each of two theories presented, followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation, in which they listed all their current goals."
2171,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The study was testing whether a belief in unlimited, malleable self-control would result in most resolutions, and indeed, this is what was found."
2172,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The experimenters had some concerns about participants' natural beliefs in relation to the passages they read, however, so in study two, the order of the two measures (lay theories and motivation/goal listing) was varied."
2173,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Data from 130 new participants revealed that, as hypothesized, if the motivation & goals questionnaire were assessed first, then among the people who believed self-control is malleable, those who also believed self-control to be unlimited (vs."
2174,0.5,0.5,0.6,limited) set more goals.
2175,0.5,0.5,0.5,"When lay theories were assessed first, this result reversed."
2176,0.5,0.5,0.5,The people who believed that self-control is fixed were unaffected by order.
2177,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The third study moved on to examine goal achievement, adding a measure to look at self-efficacy."
2178,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The study had two sessions, in November then February."
2179,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"In the first session , the 159 participants read passages about lay theories (much like in study one, but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation), listed the resolutions they were planning on making at New Years, rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions, and filled out individual difference measures (which included a self-efficacy scale)."
2180,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"And if I chose to make resolutions, I'd be far from alone--a 2008 survey on Dorthy.com found that 66% of the 2000+ adults polled had made resolutions at some point (though only 17% managed to keep them)."
2181,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Only 86 participants successfully returned for the second session, during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions."
2182,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar (take a look at any list of popular New Year's resolutions, and you'll see the majority of the goals)."
2183,0.5,0.4,0.5,"As shown in the first two studies, more goals were set by people who believe self-control is unlimited and malleable than by any other people--that is, if you expect more success, you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself."
2184,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,Self-efficacy did not have a significant effect on goal-setting.
2185,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"As far as success goes, only the interaction between lay theory and self-efficacy was significant."
2186,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"If participants believed in limited self-control and were low in self-efficacy, they tended to give up more often, failing to achieve their goals."
2187,0.5,0.4,0.5,"But if participants believed in unlimited self-control, self-efficacy had no effect; participants achieved just as many goals regardless, and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed."
2188,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Mukhopadhyay & Venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of self-control and beliefs about one's own amount of self-control and self-efficacy, and propose this as an area for future study."
2189,0.5,0.55,0.5,"But in general, lay theories about self-control can determine how much success you'll expect (and thus, how many goals you'll set), and self-efficacy beliefs can determine how much success you'll actually have."

2214,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Roy stooped to pick up a big, white caliche rock that looked like a dirty lump of chalk and handed it to Chad."
2215,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,It was Roy's favorite game.
2216,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"No, go get some stickers."

2218,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Roy had taught him to tie his shoes when Chad was five.
2219,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Roy was too slow, but he didn't dare step away from his fort."
2220,0.5,0.5,0.5,He took another careful look over his shoulder and bent to pluck a yucca spear as if that were what drew his interest.
2221,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"The long blade of the yucca had a sharp tip, but the only weapons allowed according to Humpty Dumpty Nursery rules of engagement were smelly thistles or cocklebur stems covered with spiked yellow stickers."

2224,0.55,0.35,0.44999999999999996,Meanwhile Roy stalked around the fence edge bending to pick cockleburs as he went.
2225,0.35,0.6,0.5,Chad took the rock with disgust as Roy returned to staring at his shoes.
2226,0.55,0.4,0.5,Every move Roy made since the accident was smooth and sudden and strange -- like a remote control boy.
2227,0.5,0.5,0.5,"When he saw Roy in the hospital with a shaved head and the small silver plug at the back of his noggin like a bottle cap, Chad had called him, ""Remote Control Boy."""

2229,0.5,0.5,0.5,Pop had given Chad the sideways glance that promised hard labor when they made it home.
2230,0.35,0.5,0.35,Chad just hung his head.
2231,0.5,0.5,0.5,He knew it was too late to explain that he was trying to get a smile out of Roy.

2233,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,The doctors have put something very special in Roy's brain.
2234,0.55,0.55,0.5,It's something they made for soldiers and astronauts and it's going to help Roy walk and talk to us again.
2235,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"Chad was six, and at eight Roy should have been teasing or ordering Chad around or something."
2236,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.55,Pop put a hand on Roy's shoulder.
2237,0.5,0.4,0.5,"How are you feeling, Roy?"
2238,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,Pop spoke slowly and Chad knew that he must have been practicing this with Roy.
2239,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"But the thing in his head hadn't worked yet because of something having to do with the, ""electric toads,"" which wouldn't, ""sit up."""
2240,0.5,0.5,0.5,Roy didn't really start talking for days and didn't walk until a long time after that.
2241,0.4,0.6,0.5,"Now, this year, Roy was in the same grade as Chad, and it was embarrassing."
2242,0.5,0.5,0.5,Roy stepped around the edge of the building and out of sight.
2243,0.5,0.5,0.5,Just then Tucker Williams came climbing out of the top of the black fort like a gold headed monster.
2244,0.4,0.5,0.55,"Tucker was big, even for a third grader, and he was not quite right in a different way than Roy."
2245,0.5,0.5,0.4,"Tucker was the oldest boy in the playground, and the one who decided the rules of the game."
2246,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"But since his fall the year before, Roy had been shuffling and doing what he was told."

2251,0.5,0.375,0.4375,Several more boys spewed out after him.
2252,0.65,0.8,0.6,Roy!
2253,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"Roy!"" Chad called, but his voice would only whisper"
2254,0.4175,0.5825,0.5,"He didn't want to be a crybaby, Tucker hated crybabies."
2255,0.5,0.5,0.5,The rules of the game were that Chad had to keep everyone away from his fort and away from his tumbleweed flag.
2256,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"From painful experience, he knew it wasn't going to be as easy as just pretending he was too slow or too weak to do anything."
2257,0.5625,0.4375,0.625,"Going down too easy would only make him mad, so Chad reached behind him to grab the five stickers he had managed to collect before the start of the game and readied himself."
2258,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"The boys came in quick from all sides, knocking Chad down, but he managed to roll to his feet and get one sticker off into a boy's arm before being knocked down again."
2259,0.375,0.5625,0.75,Chad strained and pounded the rock into the iron hole until he could smell the dust.
2260,0.6,0.6,0.5,Baby!
2261,0.5,0.5,0.55,Tucker was standing over him with the huge tumbleweed held high in the sun.
2262,0.5,0.8,0.6,Penis!
2263,0.30000000000000004,0.75,0.7,You didn't fight!
2264,0.5,0.5,0.5,Chad tried to tell his arms to lift him and let him reach for the tumbleweed to prove he wasn't a baby to Tucker.
2265,0.35,0.75,0.75,I'll make you fight.
2266,0.4175,0.5,0.5,Tucker leaned in low and his breath was sour as it blew in Chad's face.
2267,0.5,0.5,0.6,I'm gonna take the plug out.
2268,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Then Tucker's face became serious.
2269,0.5,0.5825,0.5,"From his pocket he pulled a small screwdriver, perfect for prying plugs from boy's heads."
2270,0.375,0.5625,0.625,"Now Chad's legs and arms and mouth worked, and he was up and running and screaming, ""Roy, go inside! Roy!"""
2271,0.5,0.625,0.5,It smelled like first grade.
2272,0.5625,0.6875,0.6875,"Roy, go inside!"
2273,0.5,0.7,0.55,Roy!
2274,0.4375,0.625,0.625,He sprinted for the corner of the building around which Roy had disappeared.
2275,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,The door was on that side and Mrs. Rayburn.
2276,0.35,0.65,0.44999999999999996,Just then a horrible pain stung Chad's cheek and neck and ear.
2277,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,The tumbleweed's yellow thorned branches scratched around him as it dug into his face.
2278,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"He wished he were there now, even if he did have to sit next to Roy."
2279,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Tucker made a grab for him but missed it, and Chad heard his shirt rip a little."
2280,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"He ran like only a small boy can run, but he was losing and he wished hard that he could fly."
2281,0.6,0.75,0.55,Roy!
2282,0.5,0.6675,0.5,"Chad rounded the corner grabbing the cinder block to help him turn faster just as Tucker came down again with the tumbleweed from behind, and the world slowed almost to a stop."
2283,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Roy stood with the bill of his cap down.
2284,0.5,0.4,0.55,"Roy held stickers in his hand like flowers, but he bent looking down and snatched something from the ground."
2285,0.4,0.6,0.44999999999999996,His hand blurred and snapped out as he stood back up.
2286,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Hey, Roy?"
2287,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Something whined as it spun past Chad's ear, and he heard a sharp, meaty thunk just behind him."
2288,0.5825,0.4175,0.5425,"The rock was too big to fit into the iron hub of the big cable spool, so Chad leaned it against the tumbleweed and slid down off the splintery wood on his belly to admire his handiwork."
2289,0.4175,0.4175,0.5825,Roy stood expressionless as ever as Chad turned to look.
2290,0.55,0.55,0.6,"Tucker towered there with a surprised expression and crossed eyes, the tumbleweed in one hand and the screwdriver held up high in the other ready to stab down into Chad's back."
2291,0.30000000000000004,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"A sharp, flat, flint rock split Tucker's forehead and was buried deep and solid like a part of a Halloween costume complete with a drop of blood just starting down toward his nose."
2292,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Tucker dropped down like a jacket from a hook.
2293,0.5,0.5,0.5,You ok?
2294,0.5,0.4,0.5,"It was Roy, and when Chad looked up there was something like his brother there around the eyes."
2295,0.55,0.5,0.4,Yeah.
2296,0.4575,0.4175,0.4575,Chad stepped back away from Tucker's open-eyed face.
2297,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"""I thought he might stab you."" Roy said and craned his neck forward to look at Tucker's face as the other boys began to crowd around at a respectful distance."
2298,0.35,0.6,0.6,I thought he might stab you.
2299,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Do you think he's dead?
2300,0.16749999999999998,0.5825,0.5,Just then Tucker blinked and began to sob.
2301,0.5,0.5,0.4,"""Nah."" Chad said, ""We're gonna be in trouble."""
2302,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,Nah.
2303,0.35,0.5,0.44999999999999996,We're gonna be in trouble.
2304,0.6,0.6,0.55,"""Yeah."" Roy said."
2305,0.5425,0.5425,0.5825,Yeah.
2306,0.5,0.55,0.55,Suddenly his blank face seemed like the face of a Play Force Soldier or a GI Joe.
2307,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Hey, Roy?"
2308,0.5,0.55,0.5,What?
2309,0.375,0.625,0.75,You suck.
2310,0.55,0.5,0.5,It was all right.
2311,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The fort was a lone, wooden cable spool like a tall barrel with thick disks on its ends, each the size of a dinner table."
2312,0.5,0.5,0.5,What?
2313,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"The sufferer says no, only those which cause no pain."
2314,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"And the artist says no, only those which cause the most pain, for those would be the truest memories."
2315,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.75,So I shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise.
2316,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.65,I will not talk of the first time Tasha and I tried any act of sex or sport together.
2317,0.5,0.5,0.5825,I can remember similar things with others.
2318,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Is that love?
2319,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,Probably not.
2320,0.6675,0.5825,0.5,"But it is something marvelous and rare, which is surely a sign of love."
2321,0.5,0.55,0.55,"If my love for her was the only important thing, I would leave a holo of her with a note: ""Dear Future, this is Tasha Cortez."
2322,0.6,0.55,0.5,You loved her.

2659,0.75,0.6,0.55,I smiled.
2660,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"""What would it hurt?"""
2661,0.625,0.5,0.625,"""True."
2662,0.6,0.6,0.6,Go ahead.
2663,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Tell her..."""
2664,0.8500000000000001,0.8,0.8,"""Tell her I love her."""
2665,0.5,0.5,0.55,"I suppose I wish to show that I'm still capable of a certain authorial distance, a semblance of dispassionate observation."
2666,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.35,"He studied me, then said, ""I'm sorry things happened this way, Bernardo."
2667,0.5,0.6,0.4,"I didn't anticipate last night --"""
2668,0.65,0.6,0.6,"""I'm very good at making things happen this way."
2669,0.30000000000000004,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"But if Tasha will forgive me --"""
2670,0.3325,0.5,0.5825,"He nodded, repeated, ""I am sorry,"" then slipped into the next room."
2671,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"""I am sorry,"""
2672,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"I heard no voices until Malaquez said, ""Enter."""
2673,0.5,0.55,0.6,"""Enter."""
2674,0.5,0.4175,0.5,I blinked when I opened the door.
2675,0.5825,0.5,0.5,Sunlight filled Malaquez's bedroom.
2676,0.55,0.7,0.5,Tasha lay sprawled nude on a rumpled bed.
2677,0.6,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the bed's teak frame.
2678,0.6,0.6,0.6,"She was looking slightly to my left, smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content."
2679,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Malaquez stood near her, pointing something at my chest."
2680,0.6,0.55,0.4,"Though the morning sun shone fully on both of them, it shimmered around Tasha."
2681,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,The part of my mind that remembered four months in NorAm during the Great Cleaning sent me rolling across the floor.
2682,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly, or perhaps he waited too long for an expression I would not have, a gesture I would not make, a poignant moment of repentence, wonder, despair, or love."
2683,0.5,0.5,0.6,The following events may indicate otherwise.
2684,0.4,0.65,0.6,"Had he been faster, he could have had rage."
2685,0.2,0.75,0.7,I threw a chair at him.
2686,0.4,0.65,0.7,"As he fell, I scrambled onto him, my knees pinning his arms, my fingers probing his neck."
2687,0.6,0.75,0.7,"I shouted, ""Where is she?"
2688,0.5,0.55,0.5,"""Where is she?"
2689,0.4,0.6,0.65,"Tell me, or I'll kill --"""
2690,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.35,He began to cry.
2691,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"""She left."
2692,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"Earlier this morning --"""
2693,0.5,0.5,0.5,Her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed.
2694,0.4,0.55,0.6,I hit him with the back of my hand.
2695,0.5425,0.4575,0.5825,"""Tell me, Malaquez."""
2696,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"""She wanted to be famous."
2697,0.5,0.5,0.65,She did!
2698,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.65,"Now she will be."""
2699,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,He seemed to expect me to understand.
2700,0.6,0.8,0.6,"""Where!"""
2701,0.4,0.65,0.65,"I demanded, squeezing his throat until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture."
2702,0.55,0.55,0.5,I stared at the naked Tasha.
2703,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In fine tourist tradition, most homes on Vega IV are named."
2704,0.35,0.7,0.65,"Most of his story I have pieced together since, but I understood enough as I knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy throat."
2705,0.5,0.5,0.55,He had made his name with a home capturador.
2706,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Now he had thought to use vacationers like Tasha and me, and when someone came looking, he would say we had gone island-hopping in our windboat."
2707,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.4,Our boat would disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose.
2708,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Mine was The Sleeping Flamingo, and its outer walls were coral pink."
2709,0.4175,0.5825,0.4175,"I wanted him to tell me more, but he babbled, begging me to forgive him, to understand."
2710,0.3325,0.5825,0.6675,I did not listen.
2711,0.5,0.4375,0.5,But I was probably only looking at my reflection in the capturador's lens.
2712,0.375,0.625,0.625,"Had he said then that I should use it on myself, I might have."
2713,0.4375,0.5,0.375,That moment passed.
2714,0.5,0.5,0.5,I looked at Malaquez.
2715,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.35,His lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound.
2716,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,I turned to touch the cube that was Tasha's crypt.
2717,0.625,0.5,0.375,"She smiled in trust or pleasure or pride, an erotic Mona Lisa who would smile forever, and I could never know why."
2718,0.55,0.5,0.75,I could free Tasha.
2719,0.55,0.55,0.55,"If I did, one of three things would happen."
2720,0.5,0.55,0.5,Most likely: she would be meat --there is a reason why stopboxes are most often used in kitchens.
2721,0.5,0.5,0.5825,Less likely: she would live the rest of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug's.
2722,0.5,0.55,0.5,"And the tiniest chance of all: she would blink as if I had just materialized in Emil's bedroom, and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal."
2723,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"The rental agent, an attractive N'apulcan named Tasha Cortez, was not mood-sensitive either."
2724,0.5,0.4,0.55,"As I put my hand on the impervious surface of Tasha's stopbox, I heard Malaquez run for the door."
2725,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,It is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we should hate.
2726,0.55,0.35,0.6,"Know this, my future self: Thanks to us, Emil Malaquez's name will live as long as his masterpiece, ""A Self-Portrait: Anguish,"" endures."
2727,0.5,0.5,0.5,And Tasha?
2728,0.375,0.4375,0.4375,I could say that I did not dare to take responsibility for her fate.
2729,0.5,0.5,0.55,"I could say that I chose out of consideration for her desire for fame; some critics already say ""Waking With Tasha"" is Malaquez's finest work."
2730,0.5825,0.5825,0.5,"If science finds a way to safely free the subjects of Emil's art, perhaps the I who reads this file will know that my decision is wise."
2731,0.35,0.55,0.35,But I cannot stop thinking that I was never afraid of losing Tasha to brain damage or death.
2732,0.4,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"My fear is that she would live, and I would learn that I had lost her long before Emil Malaquez translated her into a thing that can be kept, admired, and loved."
2733,0.6,0.55,0.55,"She said, ""It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?"""
2734,0.5,0.4375,0.4375,I am ready for the mindwipe now.
2735,0.6,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"""It's beautiful, isn't it, Señor Flynn?"""
2736,0.5,0.55,0.55,But she was young and attractive (as I have said and may say again) and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous Bernardo Flynn that I merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism.
2737,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"And then, because a playwright cannot resist a promising line, I said, ""Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep."""
2738,0.375,0.5,0.625,"""Your Sleeping Flamingo should be put to sleep."""
2739,0.5,0.5,0.5,To say her face fell would do a disservice to Tasha and to literature.
2740,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"(Allow me my self-indulgences as you would those of a dying man -- when I convince my mindsmith to permit the wipe, there will be another Bernardo Flynn, one who knows no more of Tasha Cortez or Vega IV than he reads here.)"
2741,0.55,0.6,0.6,"Her brows drew together, creasing the lovely, caramel-colored skin around her eyes and showing the pattern for an old woman's wrinkles on her forehead."
2742,0.6,0.6,0.65,"Her lower lip (a trifle too narrow for her face, perhaps her only physical flaw) thrust forward slightly as she started to speak."
2743,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"She caught herself, slid her jaw infinitesimally back into place, and said, ""You don't like it?"""
2744,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"""You don't like it?"""
2745,0.8,0.7,0.6,I laughed.
2746,0.35,0.4,0.25,What could I do?
2747,0.5,0.5625,0.5,"""Like it?"
2748,0.4,0.6,0.6,"It's gaudy, graceless, pretentious -- That house is an affront to taste and intelligence."
2749,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.65,"I should buy it to raze it, but I am not so kind-hearted."
2750,0.5,0.55,0.55,"I might, however, rent it."""
2751,0.6,0.55,0.55,Captured Moments
2752,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,I think she only heard the last words of my speech.
2753,0.55,0.6,0.5,"""You will?"""
2754,0.7,0.6,0.5,"""It amuses me."
2755,0.5,0.4,0.6,"Show me around, and then I shall decide."""
2756,0.5,0.5,0.4175,"""Of course, Señor Flynn."""
2757,0.5425,0.4575,0.5825,"Call me Bernardo."""
2758,0.55,0.55,0.5,"""If you wish."""
2759,0.3125,0.375,0.375,"""I beg you, change the color of the walls, at the very least."""
2760,0.5825,0.5825,0.6675,"""But of course!"""
2761,0.5,0.5,0.55,I stared.
2762,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""How's that?"""
2763,0.5,0.6,0.55,I looked at her.
2764,0.6,0.5,0.5,"I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday."
2765,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"""Worse?"""
2766,0.5,0.5,0.5825,I nodded.
2767,0.4375,0.375,0.4375,"""I would not have thought it possible."""
2768,0.4,0.5,0.5,She frowned.
2769,0.375,0.5,0.5,"""Thoroughly ugly,"""
2770,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"""Thoroughly ugly,"" I corrected with smile."
2771,0.04999999999999999,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"""Obscenely ugly,"""
2772,0.65,0.4,0.5,"""Obscenely ugly,"" said she, smiling too."
2773,0.55,0.55,0.55,"""No."""
2774,0.5,0.375,0.5625,I pointed.
2775,0.4175,0.375,0.5425,"""It has no tower."""
2776,0.55,0.6,0.7,"""I can fix that."""
2777,0.5,0.4175,0.5,She reached for another dial on the house controls.
2778,0.5,0.8500000000000001,0.8500000000000001,"""Don't you dare!"""
2779,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Her wrist, when I grabbed it, was smooth and strong and warm in my fingers."
2780,0.6675,0.6675,0.6675,"""I'll take it."
2781,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Exactly as it is."""
2782,0.5625,0.5625,0.5,"""You will?"""
2783,0.5,0.5,0.65,"""I must."
2784,0.4,0.65,0.6,"God knows what you might do to it next."""
2785,0.35,0.6,0.4,"Reluctantly, I released her hand."
2786,0.6,0.55,0.55,The interior of The Flamingo was a welcome surprise.
2787,0.5,0.375,0.375,"Cloudwood had been used in a Mediterranean manner, making the house seem primitive and civilized at the same time."
2788,0.6,0.55,0.5,The kitchen and baths had every convenience that I desired.
2789,0.35,0.55,0.5,"All I could say was, ""No."
2790,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it."
2791,0.8325,0.75,0.5825,"I'm in love."""
2792,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,We both thought I referred to the vista.
2793,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.65,"It's strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life, forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one would remember, and suddenly the forgotten, in revenge, rears up to savage the unwary."
2794,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,So it was as I wrote the preceding.
2795,0.55,0.6,0.55,"My heart convulsed, and I left this manuscript for a three-day spree."
2796,0.6,0.55,0.5,Apparently I was so successful that it lasted a week and a half.
2797,0.5825,0.5,0.6675,"Not bad for an eighty-three-year-old, even for one who has his rejuve every month."
2798,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"And if I can brag and digress so easily, this must not be painful enough to merit a mindwipe, yes?"
2799,0.375,0.4375,0.5,"I abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately, thinking that Bernardo Flynn should receive such services when he needed them, even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight."
2800,0.55,0.5,0.5,Captured Moments
2801,0.375,0.5,0.4375,My mindsmith is not so understanding.

2804,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,This logic does not soothe her; she says I must wait three weeks.
2805,0.6675,0.75,0.5,Three!

2807,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"I say I do not care about law, I care about service and she should care about money."
2808,0.55,0.5,0.5,"He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter."
2809,0.6875,0.5625,0.5625,"I went on a spree, and it must have been a good one."
2810,0.5625,0.4375,0.5625,I hope the wipe is as successful with my time on Vega IV as my spree was with my time here.
2811,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,"I dimly remember three bedpartners who were probably human, and one that I hope was delirium."
2812,0.4,0.55,0.65,"I will not answer the phone for a week, no matter whose face appears on it."
2813,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,I keep evading the issue.
2814,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,But which issue?
2815,0.25,0.55,0.44999999999999996,To deal with the first: it hurts to remember.
2816,0.6875,0.6875,0.5625,"If I am capable of love, I loved Tasha Cortez."
2817,0.4,0.6,0.6,"If I am not, I had the perfect mirror for my narcissism."
2818,0.5,0.5,0.5,"As for the issue itself, I'm no longer sure what I want to record."
2819,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.6,The playwright in me wants every scene of our time together.

2832,0.30000000000000004,0.4,0.4,But the anti-wolf politicians in the Alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of Alaska citizens want.

3055,0.65,0.55,0.5,Thank you for this info.
3056,0.5,0.6,0.55,I need that

3058,0.55,0.55,0.6,"Please track down and watch a movie called ""Detroit: A City to Yourself"", by Nicole MacDonald."
3059,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""Detroit: A City to Yourself"""
3060,0.5,0.4,0.5,"It's full of this imagery, and talks about the 1805 fire and rebuilding, and the post-industrial devastation that's ravaged the city since."
3061,0.35,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Most poignantly, it talks about Hurricane Katrina, which focused attention on rebuilding another city with this level of devastation, and how without a single catastrophic event to blame for it, Detroit's decay has gone unsympathetically ignored."
3062,0.55,0.35,0.5,"The movie wraps up by observing this, how abandoned buildings and spaces are being reclaimed by nature."
3063,0.55,0.55,0.55,"About the pop fiction which explores the concept of a post-human world, and how it already exists now."
3064,0.5,0.5,0.5,"And about how, if you're a pheasant, that's not such a bad thing."
3065,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,HOWEVER ...
3066,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,There's a lot more to Detroit than that.
3067,0.5,0.55,0.5,There are industrial spaces being turned into low-rent artist lofts and business incubators.
3068,0.5,0.4,0.5,"(Look at the Russell Industrial Complex, for one example.)"
3069,0.55,0.5,0.6,There are neighborhoods that refuse to cave.
3070,0.5,0.4,0.5,(west of Livernois around McNichols).
3071,0.6,0.55,0.55,"There's a whole bunch of nice stuff happening along the riverfront, from downtown up towards Stroh Place."
3072,0.44999999999999996,0.8500000000000001,0.55,"$1,900!"
3073,0.55,0.5,0.5,And there's always Belle Isle.
3074,0.5,0.5,0.5,"When friends come to Detroit, I take them there."
3075,0.6,0.4,0.5,"It's our in-the-river park, 982 acres of green space, with a zoo, a botanical garden and conservatory, rentable paddle boats, and tons of other neat stuff."
3076,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"Next time you're in Detroit, please head over."
3077,0.5,0.4,0.5,"You're liable to see families picnicking, bums gathering bottles and cans, geese foraging, and deer cautiously wandering the edge of the woods."
3078,0.55,0.6,0.5,"Some of that cheap real estate isn't too horrible, either."
3079,0.5,0.5,0.55,"There's a whole street being taken over by artists, Farnsworth between Moran and McDougall."
3080,0.7,0.65,0.55,"Some of the things they've done down there are amazing, and the community garden is a great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood."
3081,0.5,0.5,0.55,"In fact, the article went on, soon a nearby house went on the market for $100."
3082,0.4,0.5,0.55,"America's Rust Belt is a swath of cities and towns that boomed during the Industrial Era and now lie -- well, rusting -- as empty remainders of glory days past."
3083,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"A few weeks ago, someone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools."

3085,0.5,0.55,0.5,Whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own garden.
3086,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Yes, Detroit's got more than its share of bad spots, you're right."

3088,0.6,0.5,0.5,"But there are bright spots, and behind every one of them is a person, or a bunch of people, who refuse to give up."

3094,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,Love the fact that people are stealing garden implements (though it's still sad that they need to).

3098,0.5,0.55,0.65,"Well, growing up not far from Detroit myself, I would point out a few things:"
3099,0.6,0.65,0.55,I was intrigued.
3100,0.4,0.55,0.6,1. Driving a Honda in Detroit right now probably isn't really going to get you welcomed with open arms.
3101,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"See, there's a wee bit of loyalty to the Big 3 and driving a foreign car doesn't really scream ""solidarity"" to those struggling to survive."
3102,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,Really?
3103,0.5,0.5,0.6,"""solidarity"""
3104,0.5,0.55,0.5,A $100 house?
3105,0.5,0.4,0.5,Most of the funny looks you got were less about your color than about your ride.
3106,0.30000000000000004,0.75,0.55,"You think I'm kidding, but I couldn't be more serious -- that Honda is a visceral reminder for people of how the American consumer has left Detroit in the dust."
3107,0.6,0.65,0.55,"Even if it was a real fixer-upper, even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in it, that'd still be a hell of a deal."
3108,0.4,0.5,0.5,"2. Detroit (proper) has been dying for a long time -- before the 1968 riots, even."
3109,0.5,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"Its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those pockets of innovation, creativity, and vision."
3110,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.6,But its not going to happen with the investment of $100 into a single house.
3111,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The next moment, Acres was there."
3112,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Hands up in the same way mine were frozen.
3113,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,We just looked at each other.
3114,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"I guess, thinking back, I might have expected him to gloat, but the view was the kind of thing that humbles you, shuts your mouth."
3115,0.5,0.5,0.5,"We just stood looking at each other for a little while, I don't know how long."
3116,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"he wasn't the sort you'd call ""Chuck."""
3117,0.5,0.5,0.55,What is it?
3118,0.5,0.25,0.5,A place.
3119,0.4375,0.5,0.3125,I don't know.
3120,0.5,0.5,0.5,"And the markers were carved later, not be whoever built it."
3121,0.5,0.5,0.5,The markers are places where it's safe to come here and leave.
3122,0.5,0.5,0.5,Safe?
3123,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,I looked around.
3124,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.4,One thing this place didn't seem was safe.
3125,0.5,0.5,0.5,He started walking down the steps and around a corner.
3126,0.5,0.625,0.5625,"It would have taken plenty to surprise me after what I had already seen, but My jaw was banging against my shoelaces when I rounded that corner."
3127,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"'m a linguistics researcher, Ed."
3128,0.5,0.375,0.375,"I'm not sure how something so big could have been hidden by that little turn in landscape, but maybe perspective doesn't work quite the same there."
3129,0.4,0.65,0.4,"Glaring down at me from no more than twenty feet away was a grimacing, thirty foot tall black face with staring, blue and white eyes and it wore a ridiculous little hat."
3130,0.55,0.5,0.5,He took a sip and closed his eyes like the cheap cup of coffee was really something special.
3131,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Acres stood beside it and somehow using him as a yardstick for the scale of the thing made it easier to see.
3132,0.5,0.5,0.5,It was a moai.
3133,0.6,0.6,0.6,This is what I wanted to show you.
3134,0.5,0.5,0.5,I looked down and saw he was pointing to another marker just slightly different from the one we had just left.
3135,0.4175,0.5,0.3325,"I was pretty rattled, but things fell together for me looking at the big statue, the Hawaiian shirt and the mark on the ground."
3136,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Easter Island?
3137,0.4175,0.75,0.5,It was all too much for me so I focused on the part I could handle.
3138,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,So what does this have to do with gold?
3139,0.4,0.5,0.6,"You could step on that marker and make the gestures, the 'device,' and it would be like pushing a button in a very complex machine."
3140,0.55,0.55,0.65,But I know how to make it take me anywhere.
3141,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It read, ""Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, Status Report of U.S. Treasury-Owned Gold."""
3142,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"He pointed to a row that read, ""Deep Storage: Fort Knox, KY."""
3143,0.4175,0.3325,0.5,I sucked in a whole lot of air.
3144,0.5825,0.5,0.4175,Anywhere?
3145,0.55,0.6,0.55,"Anywhere,"" he walked around the moai and came back wrestling with a big, heavy bar of gold."
3146,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,They only check deep storage once a year.
3147,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Otherwise the vault is sealed.
3148,0.55,0.65,0.5,He set the cup down and looked straight at me for the first time.
3149,0.55,0.6,0.55,Does anyone else know about this?
3150,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"No, they would have been on Rapa Nui if they knew, ready to stop me."
3151,0.5,0.5,0.55,"I hadn't seen him since high-school, maybe twenty years before, and we were never buddies in the first place."
3152,0.5,0.5,0.5,This is the 400 ounces which I mentioned at the restaurant.
3153,0.5,0.55,0.55,"About $150,000 dollars at this morning's rate."
3154,0.5,0.5,0.5,I looked at the sheet in my hand.
3155,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"Deep Storage: Fort Knox, Ky."
3156,0.5,0.5,0.4175,I had to read it twice.
3157,0.5,0.6675,0.5,I had never seen a dollar sign in front of that many number before.
3158,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,"I thought they didn't keep gold there anymore, just nerve gas."
3159,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Charles put the bar down and slid a web pouch over it with shoulder straps like a small backpack.
3160,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,How's your um... business?
3161,0.5,0.5,0.5,None
3162,0.55,0.5,0.6,"But I could handle a hundred and fifty-K easy, say seventy-five-K from the fence."
3163,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Fine.
3164,0.4375,0.375,0.625,I slipped the little pouch over my back and wiped the knife on his jacket.
3165,0.5,0.35,0.7,I waived down a waitress and ordered a cup of decaf and a slice of pie.
3166,0.5,0.5,0.55,Then I made my way back to the little marker where we came in.
3167,0.4375,0.5,0.5,His mistake had been in telling me the same gesture opened the door the other way.
3168,0.4,0.55,0.55,I worried for just a moment when I started waving my hands.
3169,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,What if it didn't work?
3170,0.5825,0.5,0.5825,So the icy wind at the top of the mound and the bright moon came as a real relief.
3171,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"The gold was heavy on my back, and I was all the way to the car before I realized I had left the keys on Charles."
3172,0.5,0.55,0.5,The highway patrol was just bound to come by then.
3173,0.375,0.4375,0.5,After that it was just connect the dots back to prison.
3174,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"The rental car records pointed to Acres, and there was enough blood on the knife to match DNA from Acres comb in the motel."
3175,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,They never bothered trying to explain how Acres made it into the country without a ticket on a plane or a boat.
3176,0.25,0.4,0.55,I didn't like his tone much.
3177,0.5,0.55,0.6,"But they speculated all through the trial about where the gold came from, offered me deals."
3178,0.5,0.5,0.5,The prosecution liked the idea that Acres was my smuggler's mule.
3179,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.6,I was a one man gold cartel in the news.
3180,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""So you sure you're not a cop, Charles?"""
3181,0.5,0.5,0.4,I'm just wondering what they'll think when they open that vault in Kentucky.
3182,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,And I still wonder why Charles picked me?
3183,0.4575,0.4175,0.5425,"Maybe he didn't know anybody else with ""connections."""
3184,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"But mostly, I'm wondering what will happen when I try to make those gestures, that ""device"" right here in my cell?"
3185,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Acres said it was dangerous, but maybe I could find my way back to the mound or Easter Island even."
3186,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.2,I figure it can't be worse than the lethal injection that's waiting for me at dawn.
3187,0.4,0.5,0.65,I stared him down until he flinched.
3188,0.35,0.4,0.4,I don't really believe I'll make it or I wouldn't say a thing.
3189,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"But if I do make it, it won't matter what I tell you, because there won't be a jail that can hold me."
3190,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,I out of here.
3191,0.5,0.5,0.55,"As I did, I noticed just how tired he looked around the eyes."
3192,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,"Charlie Boy had been working hard lately, I figured."
3193,0.5,0.375,0.5,"I knew every cop in Fairport and quite a few of the state police in Iowa, and I couldn't see them bringing old Charles in as a ringer."
3194,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,'m not a cop
3195,0.25,0.4375,0.3125,"He sighed and went on in softer, sadder voice, ""I guess I'm a thief now."""
3196,0.5,0.5,0.55,Hold it.
3197,0.5,0.55,0.5,I looked around.
3198,0.375,0.4375,0.375,"Charles might be for real, but he was still going to get me in deep trouble."
3199,0.5,0.55,0.6,"Let's make real clear right now that you were joking, buddy."
3200,0.25,0.6,0.6,Otherwise this conversation is over.
3201,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.55,"I've got a parole officer to explain things to, and he wouldn't like that kinda talk."
3202,0.5,0.55,0.5,Right.
3203,0.5,0.55,0.6,Right.
3204,0.2925,0.4175,0.4575,Sorry.
3205,0.5,0.5,0.5,Charles looked out the window at the passing traffic push through dirty slush for awhile.
3206,0.5,0.5,0.5,Like I was saying.
3207,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"I'm a researcher, I've come into some valuable material that I would like to find a buyer for, and I don't want to have to explain myself to anyone."
3208,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"He said he had a ""business proposition"" for me."
3209,0.3325,0.5,0.4175,"The pie came and I waited until the waitress was gone, before going on, ""Why me?"""
3210,0.5,0.5,0.5,You were the first person who came to mind.
3211,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Twenty years out of high school?
3212,0.5,0.5,0.5,How much of this 'valuable material' are we talking about?
3213,0.55,0.55,0.5,Four Hundred ounces for a start.
3214,0.5,0.5,0.5,Four Hundred.
3215,0.5,0.5,0.5,I pulled out my palm phone and looked up a number.
3216,0.5,0.5,0.6,That's alot.
3217,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,He drained the last of his cup and tossed some bills on the table.
3218,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,I'm staying in town.
3219,0.5,0.65,0.6,Let me show you something.
3220,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"I thought about it and made a quick call, just telling a buddy that I was ""postponing our meeting,"" for a couple of hours, meaning he should come looking for me if I didn't show up."
3221,0.5,0.6675,0.5825,"He sounded surprised and said no, he needed me to help him get rid of ""a large quantity of gold."""
3222,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Charles might not look like much, but I hadn't made it through my life taking that kind of chance."
3223,0.5,0.55,0.6,I put away the cell and used the motion to cover checking the knife in my sleeve and used one leg to check the other in my sock.
3224,0.5,0.55,0.55,One of my best tricks was pulling a knife out of thin air.
3225,0.6675,0.5825,0.5,It never failed to amaze.
3226,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Sure.
3227,0.5,0.5625,0.625,"Let's go,"" I said."
3228,0.5,0.5,0.5,We took his rental car back to the motel where he was staying.
3229,0.5,0.5,0.375,"The little desk was covered with large books filled with sticky notes, a pile of folders and papers and a laptop computer plugged into the phone line."
3230,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"There was only one chair, so I sat on the edge of the bed as he handed me a book open to a picture of some sort of stone tablet."
3231,0.5,0.4,0.55,This codex is one of the few remaining examples of a form of writing known as 'rongorongo.
3232,0.5,0.5,0.6675,I told him I'd meet him for coffee at the diner down the street at seven.
3233,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"For a long time no one was able to decipher it, although by deduction, Steven Fischer deciphered some of it in nineteen ninety four."
3234,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He mostly read creation stories off objects like the 'Santiago Staff' which said things like, 'All the birds copulated with fish: There issued forth the sun."
3235,0.5,0.5,0.5,But he ignored the inscriptions on skulls and the 'Birdman' statuette.
3236,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,It was those clues that started all of this.
3237,0.5,0.5,0.5,I didn't see much money in hieroglyphic porn.
3238,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He talked on about people with long ears who built the big statues, the ""moai"" and people with short ears who conquered the people with long ears and ate them and how the short eared people didn't really know the secrets of the long ears and had pulled down all the moai statues and destroyed some of the tablets."
3239,0.55,0.5,0.6,I was there early.
3240,0.5,0.5,0.5,And how the missionaries came and the converted natives had destroyed more.
3241,0.55,0.4,0.6,"He flipped pages to another image, ""But notice something here in the arrangement of the moai."
3242,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"See here how they form a pattern, very similar to this?"
3243,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,He pulled out a small leather diary and opened it to a yellowed page marked with yet another small sticky note.
3244,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.4,There was an ink drawing and writing in a tiny neat hand that I couldn't read from where I sat.
3245,0.5,0.5,0.5,I didn't see much resemblance except maybe there were about the same number of points in the cat's cradle thing in the diary and the number of dots on the map showing places where statues stood in a thin line around the coast of the island.
3246,0.5,0.4,0.4,"he was already there, sitting in a booth, warming his hands on a cup of coffee."
3247,0.5,0.5,0.5,This is the diary of a mysterious explorer named Samuel Curlew who investigated a Mound Builder site in this area in the early eighteen hundreds.
3248,0.75,0.5625,0.5625,He closed the little book and just about hugged it with satisfaction.
3249,0.5,0.5,0.5,I want to show you that mound.
3250,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"You know it was these very mounds that originally sparked my interest in history, archeology and then linguistics."
3251,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,And this mound is where you found gold?
3252,0.4,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"I was confused enough I let the ""G word"" slip."
3253,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Was this some crazy treasure hunt?
3254,0.35,0.65,0.44999999999999996,Or maybe this guy was just a wacko who wanted to take me out on a dark road and kill me.
3255,0.4,0.55,0.6,"No, it's more complicated than that, but I need to show you the mound for you to understand."
3256,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,He looked like jerked meat on the bone.
3257,0.55,0.65,0.5,The drawings and the books seemed to wake him up.
3258,0.6,0.5,0.44999999999999996,He was smiling now and his eyes weren't so tired.
3259,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Charles Acres called me on a Thursday afternoon, just like that."
3260,0.35,0.4,0.4,"I was having serious cash flow issues back then and had payments to make, so I said, ""yes,"" but my patience was running out."
3261,0.5,0.5,0.5,It was dark as we left.
3262,0.4375,0.4375,0.5625,"He was wearing a new jacket and snow boots, but he had on a Hawaiian shirt underneath and khaki shorts of all things."
3263,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,When he killed the headlights there was no light but moonlight and stars on a light dusting of snow.
3264,0.5,0.5,0.5,"A low, black hill blocked the sky right in front of us."
3265,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"We spent the next hour stomping around the hill while he said things like, ""it was right here."""
3266,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"My patience was long gone, and I was back in the car to warming up when Acres tapped on the window and told me he had found whatever he was looking for."
3267,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,We trudged back up the hill and he led me to little patch of ground with a stick poking up from it.
3268,0.5,0.5,0.5,It looked like a bamboo walking stick.
3269,0.5,0.5,0.6,"""This is it,"" he leaned down and motioned for me to look at something on the ground."
3270,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,This is it
3271,0.3325,0.375,0.4575,I casually slid a knife into my palm just in case.
3272,0.5,0.55,0.5,"See how the lines form the pattern in the journal, the same one as the moai."
3273,0.375,0.5,0.375,"""So you drew this?"" I asked vaguely, slow to catch on."
3274,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,So you drew this?
3275,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.44999999999999996,He looked hurt and rapped on the ground with his finger.
3276,0.5,0.55,0.55,It's stone.
3277,0.5,0.4,0.5,Ancient.
3278,0.5,0.55,0.65,"For the first time he looked cold and stiff in his tourist gear, making me glad I was in a suit."
3279,0.5,0.5,0.5,"His tan was obviously deep and old, but it looked like a work tan, not the kind you get at the beach."
3280,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Here stand beside me,"" he said."
3281,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,I'm not sure if I can take you with me so I need to show you the device.
3282,0.5,0.5,0.5,Device?
3283,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,I expected him to pull out a gadget with blinking lights and was wondering which way to duck.
3284,0.5,0.5,0.5,It's like sleight of hand.
3285,0.55,0.55,0.6,"OK, watch and remember this."
3286,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"I'm going to do it in two parts, last part first so it won't take effect."
3287,0.5,0.5,0.5,Remember to reverse the two parts when you actually do it.
3288,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Stunned I watched as he made several ridiculous passes with his hands paused and nodded then did a sort of sign language stutter of some sort.
3289,0.5,0.55,0.55,"I learned this from a skull shard rongorongo, they aren't all writing language."
3290,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,Some are just a memory device.
3291,0.6,0.6,0.55,"""Mnemonic."" I muttered, which seemed to please him."
3292,0.5,0.5,0.5,Mnemonic.
3293,0.6,0.6,0.65,Yes.
3294,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,They help in remembering steps in a ritual or ceremonial gestures.
3295,0.5,0.5,0.5,There's a long history of Polynesian gesture and dance language.
3296,0.65,0.55,0.44999999999999996,He smiled and I could see his teeth in the moonlight.
3297,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,His hands were thin and huge knuckled with obvious callouses.
3298,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.35,I even swapped the two parts as he had asked.
3299,0.5,0.6,0.5,"I thought he was surprised at my dexterity when his jaw dropped, but he shouted, ""No!"" just before everything changed."
3300,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.4,"For as far as I could see by a weak, gray light the stone stepped up and down making little hills and terraces and platforms."
3301,0.55,0.5,0.55,I seemed to be somewhere in the middle -- there was as much above as below.
3302,0.55,0.5,0.5,"So, the mining business is treating you pretty good, huh Charles?"
3303,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.55,The sky was dull and featureless and overcast.
3304,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"The air smelled bad in some way I can't describe, and at my feet I could see the same design from the little journal and the mound carved into the rock."
3305,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.5,I was in shock.
3306,0.35,0.65,0.55,"and how can the state legislature single out two counties (first Napa, now Sonoma) for this treatment?"
3307,0.5,0.4,0.4,JohnLopresti said...
3308,0.4375,0.4375,0.5,vive la OIVV OIV_Wine_Labelling_Standard_EN_2006 re at Fredric K's BTYH website there is a review discussing MacRostie pinot noir.
3309,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"I had thought of the kiltman with respect to a new AVA in Yorkville highlands, thinking the Scot might have interest in playing the bagpipes in the uplands."
3310,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Then, at Steve's site there is an interesting discussion of his current ongoing efforts with blends from Carneros and Sonoma Coast."
3311,0.5,0.4,0.5,There are 13 AVAs in Sonoma County.
3312,0.5,0.4,0.5,"It's easy to get lost in nomenclatures, when one is striving for new concepts."
3313,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In a way, all this tries to approach terroir from a slight distance; plus the historical distinctions between the two premium distinctive varietal regions, Napa county and Sonoma county."
3314,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"The problem, of course, is that by placing the words ""Sonoma County"" on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in ""Russian River Valley"", ""Dry Creek Valley"", ""Sonoma Valley"" or any other AVA in Sonoma"
3315,0.5,0.4375,0.5,Winkler heat summation datapoints also clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic underpinnings of why Napa county and Sonoma county were the natural leaders in premium winegrape production.
3316,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,There are many reasons why the new labeling requirement makes sense from all these perspectives.
3317,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,JohnLopresti said...
3318,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"sorry, I keep forgetting the Fermentation site's html protocol; here is the OIVV label guideline link again:"
3319,0.5,0.5,0.5,El Jefe said...
3320,0.5,0.5,0.5,"OK, so here's the real requirement: ""Any wine labeled with an American Viticultural Area established yada yada, that is located entirely within yada yada, shall bear the designation ""Sonoma County"" on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters on containers of more than 187 milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on containers of 187 milliliters or less."
3321,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"If I recall correctly, this is almost exactly the same as the requirement for the government warning type size."
3322,0.5,0.5,0.5,Johnonwine said...
3323,0.5,0.35,0.7,"But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands ""Napa Valley"", in addition to simply ""Rutherford"", be placed on these wines."
3324,0.5,0.4,0.55,"It has to do entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making ""Napa Valley"" a place associated with great wines."
3325,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Such an association will not be made with ""Sonoma County"" wines...ever."
3326,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Tom, I would suggest that all Napa wineries, good and bad, benefit from having Napa Valley on the label; it is indeed a great example of marketing - what you describe as promotional effort."
3327,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"County, consumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle."
3328,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Sonoma County, with roughly half of the wineries of Napa County, wins roughly twice as many gold medals in national and international wine competitions."
3329,0.625,0.5,0.5,"That, the fact that their wines cost less on average, and the wineries are friendlier, less snooty is a compelling story to get out to the public."
3330,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Heck, if folks knew all that, maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with ""Sonoma County"" on the label."
3331,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,"You suggest that this is a bad law, that Sonoma County will never be associated with high quality wine in the way Napa County is."
3332,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"I disagree, but I am eternally hopeful, optimistic that the Sonoma County Vintners will inject a little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in their marketing communications."
3333,0.5,0.5,0.5,"There no evidence that grapes grown in ""Sonoma County"" have any single distinguishing feature derived from the fact that they were grown inside the borders of Sonoma County. Assemblywoman Evans concludes, ""By improving consumer education on each bottle, conjunctive labeling will unleash the full potential of our delicious wines to represent Sonoma around the world."
3334,0.6,0.5,0.55,"I have confidence they will change, retool, improve, live up to their responsibilities."
3335,0.5,0.4375,0.5,The story is simple.
3336,0.5625,0.4375,0.5625,People are receptive to it.
3337,0.75,0.5825,0.5825,Selling the magic of Sonoma County wines is easy.
3338,0.4,0.5,0.65,"That's my take anyway, I don't aim to be contrarian, but I don't mind being the sole supporter of the law - as a Sonoma County born and bred wine guy."
3339,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,She's correct.
3340,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Beginning in 2014, ""Sonoma County"" will receive a tremendous boost in recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add more wording to their labels—whether they think the words ""Sonoma County"" help or hurt their marketing efforts."
3341,0.5,0.375,0.5,"Honore Comfort, Executive Director of the Sonoma County Vintners Association and an outstanding representative for Sonoma County wines noted this: ""."
3342,0.6,0.6,0.55,"""This moment ...marks the beginning of a stronger Sonoma County brand for generations to come."""
3343,0.5,0.35,0.5,"Proponents of the new Sonoma County Conjunctive labeling law like to point to a similar law that demands ""Napa Valley"" be placed on all wines that are made from grapes grown in that appellation, rather than simply using a sub appellation."
3344,0.5,0.4,0.5,"They point to the prestige that the ""Napa Valley"" designation carries."
3345,0.5,0.55,0.55,"But this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands ""Napa Valley"", in addition to simply ""Rutherford"", be placed on these wines."
3346,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The vintners in Sonoma County simply can't make a case for ""Sonoma County"" having any meaning or for a region as vast as ""Sonoma County"" delivering any degree of quality to the grapes."
3347,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Pushed as an effort to promote ""Sonoma County"" wines and a consumer education effort, the new law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines their own marketing efforts."
3348,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This is an example of a County usurping the private label real estate, and it's very valuable real estate, for the sake of promoting something that is of little use to private commercial interests."
3349,0.5,0.5,0.6,"Ask yourself...If putting the words ""Sonoma County"" on one's wines was such a great thing, why don't more vintners who make ""Dry Creek Valley"", ""Russian River Valley"", ""Alexander Valley"" or ""Sonoma Valley"" wines already put these words on their label?"
3350,0.5,0.5,0.5,Eminent Domain Used To Usurp Wine Label Real Estate
3351,0.5,0.5,0.5,They legally could...if they wanted to.
3352,0.5,0.5,0.55,The new Sonoma County conjunctive labeling law is the equivalent of the State of California and the County of Sonoma claiming imminent domain over the labels of hundreds of vintners.

3356,0.65,0.6,0.5,You found a way to tie this in nicely.
3357,0.4,0.5,0.55,"This is a case of over-reaching government regulation, costing business unnecessarily and burdening them with more regulations."
3358,0.35,0.55,0.55,It's just unnecessary.
3359,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"It also is a 'social promotion' in the sense that great Sonoma wines that now are forced to use ""Sonoma County"" will be giving some of their credibility to their lesser neighbors."

3385,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,But I think it will improve northcoast revenue and dignity.
3386,0.5,0.5,0.5,"When I was a kid in a county called Solano (not too famous for wines or AVAs) people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte 37 was, where was Black Pt.; people always were confused how the somewhat neighboring counties had such similar names."

3388,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Now after several decades in Sonoma county I have learned to appreciate its uniqueness, for its viticulture and other industries."
3389,0.5,0.5,0.5,The town of Sonoma is on a typical route people follow driving from Solano County to Sonoma County.

3525,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"""State laws that raise concerns can and should be addressed in the state legislature."""
3526,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"The wholesalers would have argued that the racist ""separate but equal"" philosophy had no business being litigated and that we should wait for the legislatures that enacted the racist laws to overturn them with new laws."
3527,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,We have courts precisely to adjudicate concerns with the fairness and constitutionality of state laws.
3528,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,It appears that wholesalers don't like the courts involved when the decision don't go their way.

3564,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"We are supported entirely by donations from generous individuals, corporations and foundations."
3565,0.55,0.65,0.55,Thus originated Las Vegas’s reputation as an adult theme park.
3566,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife."
3567,0.5,0.5,0.5,Additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from World War II.
3568,0.5,0.25,0.5,"Both the Las Vegas Aerial Gunnery School (which became Nellis Air Force Base and the Nevada Test Site) in the north, and Basic Magnesium in the nearby town of Henderson, arrived in the early 1940s as a result of America’s war effort."
3569,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"By 1945, the population had grown to almost 20,000, with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace."
3570,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,But this was not yet the Las Vegas of folklore.
3571,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The El Rancho Vegas (1941) was the first, followed by the Last Frontier (1943)."
3572,0.5,0.5,0.55,"During this period, East Coast Syndicate member Benjamin “Bugsy” Siegel earned a foothold as a local casino operator."
3573,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"When the Flamingo opened in December 1946, it did so with Hollywood flair and the new Vegas flash."
3574,0.5,0.55,0.55,Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis.
3575,0.35,0.5,0.5,But the Mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance; Siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947.
3576,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Despite its initial failings, Siegel’s Flamingo survived him, as did mob infiltration of casinos."
3577,0.4375,0.5,0.625,"Freely flowing “comps” (complimentary food, drink, and entertainment) were the order of the day, with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in."
3578,0.55,0.55,0.6,"From the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s, Las Vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the “Entertainment Capital of the World. ”"
3579,0.6,0.5,0.6,"Emerging stars, no longer content with playing small nightclubs, came to Las Vegas with dreams of making it big."
3580,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,Many of them did.
3581,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton, and Louis Prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written."
3582,0.5,0.5,0.55,"For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization."
3583,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The Rat Pack — originally Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. , Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, all in town to film Ocean’s 11 — landed at the Sands in January 1960 for a legendary stay."
3584,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Other Hollywood stars came as well, simply because Las Vegas was the place to be."
3585,0.6,0.55,0.55,"As a result, more casinos emerged along the Strip."
3586,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"The Thunderbird, Desert Inn, Sahara, Sands, and Riviera hotels were erected during this period, luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of all-night partying, exclusive entertainment, and cheap accommodations."
3587,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"There was no longer any question: when you wanted some unbridled adult fun, Las Vegas was the place to be."
3588,0.5,0.4375,0.5,New Legitimacy
3589,0.5,0.5,0.5,Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash.
3590,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities."
3591,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley."
3592,0.55,0.55,0.5,"A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos."
3593,0.4375,0.5,0.625,"True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn’s penthouse."
3594,0.4,0.55,0.5,"Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management."
3595,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Thus began Hughes’ legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree."
3596,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains."
3597,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting."
3598,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes’ investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant."
3599,0.5,0.5,0.5,"That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city."
3600,0.55,0.5,0.6,Las Vegas with a Vision
3601,0.55,0.6,0.55,"As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged."
3602,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest."
3603,0.5,0.55,0.5,The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US.
3604,0.55,0.6,0.55,What was once a sure thing became much more competitive.
3605,0.5,0.5,0.5,Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business.
3606,0.5,0.5,0.55,"The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget."
3607,0.55,0.55,0.6,"In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort."
3608,0.6,0.6,0.55,He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.
3609,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a trend that, more than any other, describes Las Vegas at the end of the 20th century: removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones."
3610,0.5,0.375,0.5,"This trend has led to many more demolitions, including the Dunes (replaced by Bellagio), Aladdin (the new Aladdin) and Sands (Venetian) hotels."
3611,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,Wynn’s casinos have also set new standards.
3612,0.5,0.55,0.6,"They can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables, restaurants, and a showroom."
3613,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Excalibur, the MGM Grand, the Luxor, and New York-New York all followed Mirage’s lead during the 1990s, offering themed environments and attractions for families."
3614,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"As evidence of the “ever-faster” nature of the city, by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash, with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the Las Vegas experience."
3615,0.55,0.55,0.5,This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife.
3616,0.5,0.5,0.5,The latest approach is perhaps the best of the post-mob era: the comprehensive resort.
3617,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"New resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide, including luxurious spas, signature restaurants, and exclusive boutiques."
3618,0.6,0.5,0.55,"Additionally, a handful of resorts — such as the South-Seas themed Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, and the new Four Seasons — are now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market."
3619,0.5,0.55,0.5,The crème de la crème of Las Vegas deluxe is Steve Wynn’s Bellagio.
3620,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Perhaps more important, such high-end accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the Rat Pack era."
3621,0.5,0.55,0.5,"As it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming venue, the population of Las Vegas skyrocketed."
3622,0.65,0.65,0.6,"Over 20,000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years, including resorts in Summerlin and Lake Las Vegas."
3623,0.375,0.375,0.5625,The growth that has characterized Las Vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock.
3624,0.5,0.35,0.55,"Still, the future of Las Vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else."
3625,0.65,0.65,0.55,"With its new look and new aim, the prospects are good despite the warnings."
3626,0.5,0.3325,0.5,"Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d. 1150, leaving it to be repopulated by the Southern Paiutes, another hunter-gatherer tribe."
3627,0.5,0.5,0.5,"And that, more than anything, is the one constant that characterizes the past, present, and future of Las Vegas."
3628,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the Anasazi, the Paiutes were destined to a semi-nomadic lifestyle until European settlers arrived, changing the nature of existence in the valley forever."
3629,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,"During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline."
3630,0.5,0.4,0.55,From Mailmen to Mormons
3631,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It was not until 1829 that Rafael Rivera, a Mexican scout, found a spring-fed valley and dubbed it Las Vegas — a Spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where “the meadows” really lay."
3632,0.5,0.5,0.5,"For fifteen years, Las Vegas was used as a Spanish Trail way-station."
3633,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,A Brief History
3634,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In 1844, American explorer John C. Fremont parked his horses at Big Springs, and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to California."
3635,0.5,0.5,0.55,This put Las Vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history.
3636,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In 1855, Mormon leader Brigham Young responded to promising reports of Las Vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley; they eventually built a fort not far from today’s Downtown."
3637,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert, the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of Las Vegas for the next fifty years."
3638,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries.
3639,0.4,0.6,0.35,"The missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert, trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the Mormon faith."
3640,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.35,Additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery.
3641,0.4,0.55,0.4,"Their supplies scarce, their harvest meager, and their spirit broken, they abandoned the fort in 1858."
3642,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver, by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of prospectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold."
3643,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes Las Vegas to this day, Gass redirected his life by picking up where the Mormons left off — at least when it came to ranching and farming."
3644,0.5,0.5,0.5,The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated.
3645,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Gass took over the abandoned Mormon fort and 640 acres (260 hectares) surrounding it, dubbing it the Las Vegas Ranch."
3646,0.5,0.5,0.5,He expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle.
3647,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Despite his ambition, Gass’ success was short-lived."
3648,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"In the late 1870s, he defaulted on a loan from rancher Archibald Stewart, so Stewart took the Las Vegas Ranch for his own."
3649,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"True to wild-West stereotypes, Stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer, leaving his strong-willed wife, Helen, to assume the duties of the ranch."
3650,0.5,0.5,0.5,Fossils tell an obscure story of man’s slow and sporadic development.
3651,0.5825,0.5,0.5,"Through 1905, Helen Stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres (810 hectares), making quite a bit of money in the process."
3652,0.5,0.55,0.55,Early Habitation
3653,0.4175,0.5,0.5,What happened next would mark the end of the successful Las Vegas Ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of Western America to this day.
3654,0.5,0.5,0.5,Of Tracks and Tracts
3655,0.5,0.4,0.5,At the turn of the 19th century Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new American West.
3656,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"When it did, the Las Vegas Valley (which at the time had a non-native population of less than 30) would change as well."
3657,0.55,0.5,0.55,"Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture."
3658,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In 1903, officials of the San Pedro, Los Angeles, and Salt Lake Railroad arrived in Las Vegas, eager to secure a right-of-way for their Los Angeles–Salt Lake connection."
3659,0.5,0.5,0.5,Las Vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair.
3660,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"As mapped, the track traveled directly through Helen Stewart’s Las Vegas Ranch."
3661,0.5,0.5,0.55,Stewart sold 99.5 percent of her ranch to the railroad.
3662,0.5,0.5,0.5625,The remainder she returned to the native Paiutes.
3663,0.6,0.55,0.6,"In early 1905, the route between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City was completed, and train tracks bore right down the center of the Las Vegas Valley."
3664,0.6,0.5,0.5,"On 15 May 1905, the railroad held a land sale — a momentous step in Las Vegas history."
3665,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Standing at the depot at Main and Fremont streets, railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub."
3666,0.5,0.5,0.5,"By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas."
3667,0.5,0.4375,0.625,Las Vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement.
3668,0.55,0.35,0.4,"With rail service in place and forty blocks of private property, it was ready to become a real town."
3669,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,"One year after the auction, the population of Las Vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents, a portent of things to come for the next ninety years."
3670,0.6,0.5,0.5,Dam Good Luck
3671,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"From the beginning, Las Vegas was built to serve travelers."
3672,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake."
3673,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The railroad needed a way station, and Las Vegas was the place."
3674,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop."
3675,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,But such heady progress would soon come to a halt.
3676,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility."
3677,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada’s new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling."
3678,0.375,0.3125,0.5,These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents.
3679,0.5625,0.625,0.625,"But the southwest’s growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity."
3680,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas."
3681,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Providing an influx of $165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally."
3682,0.6875,0.625,0.6875,"Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada."
3683,0.55,0.55,0.5,More Government Help
3684,0.5,0.3325,0.5,"The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however."

3686,0.5,0.5,0.5,They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted.
3687,0.5,0.55,0.5,It didn’t take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an “anything goes” attitude.
3688,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night)."
3689,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Strangely enough, the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins, and out of the 142 homosexual males studied, only 14, or about 9 %, had homosexual brothers, which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population (Bailey & Pillard)."
3690,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"More and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a “choice,” but rather a feeling that one is born with."
3691,0.55,0.5,0.6,"“choice,”"
3692,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex."
3693,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"Therefore, neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a “choice” in the matter, and asking a homosexual “Why are you attracted to other members of your sex” is likened to asking a heterosexual “Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?”"
3694,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,“Why are you attracted to other members of your sex”
3695,0.5,0.5,0.5,“Why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex?”
3696,0.5,0.4,0.5,"As a homosexual, one risks horrifying their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more."
3697,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"Rather, the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with one’s sexuality and sexual preference; whether to act on one’s sexual desires, whether to tell others about such feelings, or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions (Marcus 9)."
3698,0.5,0.55,0.5,"This shows that not only did Plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male, he also believed that it began at a very young age, as the word “boyhood” signifies."
3699,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"To supplement my findings from research, I have conducted personal interviews with two adolescent homosexual males, James Dobbens and Daniel Woods."
3700,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. nurture) and why, when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions."
3701,0.44999999999999996,0.7,0.6,Dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual; “They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’
3702,0.4,0.7,0.6,“They’re not like ‘My child’s going to be gay!”’
3703,0.6675,0.8325,0.5825,‘My child’s going to be gay!”’
3704,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual.
3705,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“It’s just the way you are, you can’t explain it, I was just born that way, it’s like asking how the world was made – no one really knows”"
3706,0.5,0.55,0.6,"He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it."
3707,0.5,0.55,0.5,"When discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a child’s sexuality, he commented “They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up” (Dobbens)."
3708,0.6,0.5,0.6,"“They can bring you up [to be] open minded to [homosexuality], but they don’t bring you up [to be a homosexual]… I grew up in a place where [homosexuality is accepted], so that’s why I’m so open about being gay; I accept myself… [Whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual] depends on how you’re brought up”"
3709,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,"Woods generally agreed with Dobbens, and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by one’s nature, rather than nurture, when he commented that “there’s nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like [homosexuality]” (Woods)."
3710,0.5,0.5,0.5,“boyhood”
3711,0.5,0.5,0.55,"In fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only “real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy."
3712,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females, only it was between males and other males."
3713,0.5,0.5,0.5,He added that “nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there.
3714,0.55,0.55,0.5,“nothing happened [to make me homosexual]; it’s always been there. I’ve always been attracted to guys”
3715,0.5425,0.4575,0.5825,I’ve always been attracted to guys” (Woods).
3716,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"What I find to be extraordinary about Woods’ case is that he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys, he is romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend and to be close with other females, etc… but never in a sexual sense."
3717,0.5625,0.6875,0.5625,"Though he has “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods)."
3718,0.5,0.55,0.5,"What, exactly, causes homosexuality?"
3719,0.55,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"He says that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust, maybe he could work it out."
3720,0.75,0.5,0.6675,“real and lasting love”
3721,0.5,0.5,0.4,"“It’s like race. It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it”"
3722,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"It’s all something you can’t help; it all comes to you… It’s internal, you can’t help it” (Woods)."
3723,0.5,0.4,0.4,"When asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene, he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct."
3724,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Furthermore, there were many occurrences of homosexual behavior in Greek mythology; Hercules is rumored to have had 14 male lovers, and Zeus himself partook in such behavior."
3725,0.5,0.5,0.5,Woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo.
3726,0.5,0.5,0.55,"All in all, Woods views homosexuality as “fascinating.”"
3727,0.65,0.55,0.55,“fascinating.”
3728,0.5,0.5,0.625,His final thought: “I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction.
3729,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,“I also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction. It’s not black and white [homosexual vs. heterosexual]; it’s a spectrum”
3730,0.55,0.5,0.55,Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics.
3731,0.5,0.5,0.5,"According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, the advantageous traits are passed on, while the disadvantageous ones eventually die out."
3732,0.5,0.5,0.5,"For instance, heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones, as a female is required to reproduce children, yet homosexuals are, by definition, not sexually attracted to females."
3733,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits."
3734,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool, if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene, it would have died out entirely by now, or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences."
3735,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"Since neither of these events have yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene (Fulkerson)."
3736,0.5,0.5,0.55,My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality.
3737,0.375,0.4375,0.5,"No one knows for sure now (although many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth."
3738,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"Nonetheless, I am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes."
3739,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations.
3740,0.5825,0.4175,0.5,"Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love (Emond)."
3741,0.5,0.5,0.55,However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors.
3742,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This seems to be the most likely explanation as of now, but even as I write this, new studies are being done."
3743,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,Perhaps the truth is right around the corner.

3756,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for “sex,” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex” (Marcus 1)."

3761,0.5425,0.4575,0.5,"It was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was started by Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician, sex researcher, leading sexologist, homosexual, and founder of the first gay rights movement in Germany, who believed that homosexuality was biological in nature (Marcus 10)."
3762,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"Hirschfeld also founded the Scientific Humanitarian committee, which was mostly homosexual, in 1897."
3763,0.5825,0.4575,0.5,"The committee published many books and other forms of literature, which gave Hirschfeld a great amount of prestige in his field."
3764,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later."
3765,0.5,0.5,0.5,Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be cured.
3766,0.5,0.5,0.6,The debate over homosexuality has been one of the most long-lasting and controversial ones ever.
3767,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Hirschfeld largely supported the Urning theory of Karl Ulrichs, with minor additions; he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of homosexuality, but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to “cure” homosexuals with the use of hormone injections."
3768,0.4175,0.5,0.4175,"This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in1864."
3769,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The first, Vindex, defended Urnings, while the second, Inclusa, which followed shortly after, described the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire."
3770,0.5,0.55,0.5,"“hermaphrodites of the mind,”"
3771,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Perhaps then, it is a combination of some of these?"
3772,0.5,0.5,0.5,"This, he claimed, made laws such as paragraph 175, a law adopted by King William I throughout the German Kingdoms at the time of their unification which forbade sex between males, and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior, unfair and unreasonable ."
3773,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"No one knows for sure, and it is possible no one ever will, but that surely does not stop everyone from coming up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter."
3774,0.5,0.55,0.55,"A couple thousand years after Plato and Homer, Sigmund Freud still believed homosexuality to be a natural behavior."
3775,0.5,0.5,0.625,"In an interview in 1903, he professed his beliefs: “I am… of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people… Homosexual persons are not sick."

3779,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness."
3780,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Treatments such as castration, hysterectomy, lobotomy, and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures."
3781,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"By the mid 1900s, psychotherapy became the most common “cure,” and many homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual preference (Dudley 125)."
3782,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud."
3783,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual and half heterosexual."
3784,0.4,0.4,0.5,"She disagreed with the popular belief at the time that homosexuality was a mental illness, and concluded that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men; “gay” men were no more insane than their “straight” counterparts (Marcus 183)."
3785,0.25,0.75,0.6675,“gay”
3786,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient Greece and other cultures of the time, where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence (Emond)."
3787,0.5,0.6,0.6,"Fortunately, many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness, and their lobbying, along with the innovative study performed by Hooker, who has been referred to as “the Rosa Parks of the gay movement” convinced the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual as a mental illness in December of 1973."
3788,0.5,0.5,0.5,“the Rosa Parks of the gay movement”
3789,0.5625,0.625,0.375,"Just over a year later, the American Psychological Association also removed homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses (Marcus 11)."
3790,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The American Psychological Association further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the Council of Representatives adopted the Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in 1997, which publicly chastised those who attempted to “cure” homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment."

3792,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"It stated, rather that homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person, but must still be respected as an individual orientation, and thus treated as one (Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation)."
3793,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by Michael Bailey, an assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern University, and Richard Pillard, an associate professor of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics."
3794,0.5,0.5,0.5,"For two years, these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic, or identical twins (a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg and thus having identical DNA), and dizygotic, or fraternal twins (a set of twins from too separate zygotes, causing them to have similar DNA, but not any more so than that of two ordinary siblings), in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males (meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment)."
3795,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote “Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men” (qtd. in Isay 11)."
3796,0.5,0.5,0.5,"In total, 110 pairs of twins (identical and fraternal) and 142 sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied, where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual, either by self-identification or other means."
3797,0.5425,0.6675,0.5425,"“Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men”"
3798,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"Out of the 56 homosexual males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately 22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 % of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics."
3799,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"Me, I found a space suit, but it was statistically unlikely that I, and whomever else has followed suit (pun intended), would manage to repair our ship before the less-than-twenty-four hours are up; yes, studies have been done."
3800,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"I could have started asking questions, but I wanted to get my bearings first."
3801,0.5,0.5,0.5,Tonight was for observation.
3802,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"I didn't bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people, though."
3803,0.5,0.5,0.5,"They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared."
3804,0.5,0.4575,0.5,I wondered at the ship instead.
3805,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"All the fine food and the ornamental lighting, it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain."
3806,0.5,0.4,0.4,"If the barkeep was any indication, I suspected similarly high-class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship."
3807,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"How they were all powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink."
3808,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"It was the brain, mostly; the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources."
3809,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,I slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen movies—that I had seen during off-time at Geminia Station.
3810,0.65,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"By the end of the evening, when I finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room, a satisfying haze had settled on my mind."
3811,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,This ship.
3812,0.5,0.5,0.5,This life.
3813,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Did it truly matter what the ship's origin was and why Jefferson had saved me, if now, I was content?"
3814,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"I would wake late, checking the clock on my room's lightscreen to make sure I hadn't slept through brunch."
3815,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.65,"I would watch old films on the entertainment screens, taking mental notes for later dinnertime discussions."
3816,0.5,0.4175,0.5,I would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks.
3817,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"I would attend afternoon dance classes, so that when the evening dances came around (modeled after the historical social gatherings of several hundred years prior), I would be less of an embarrassment to myself."
3818,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"So, twenty-four hours."
3819,0.5,0.5,0.6,I did not ask questions.
3820,0.5,0.5,0.5,I told myself I should.
3821,0.55,0.55,0.6,"I told myself that tonight, the observation period would end and I'd start puzzling out the ship's mystery."
3822,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"Bereft of my previous familiar life, I latched onto Kishori and Ray and Zheng, and Sarah with Alexis dragged along on her arm now and then (he was mostly her favorite dancing partner; she confided to us one night that his conversational skills left something to be desired)."
3823,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"About the time I was composing my last words in my head, trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like, that's when I heard a bell."
3824,0.625,0.5,0.5625,"I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth—this was my long-awaited vacation, my clean break and my temporary retreat; I'd try contacting those friends tomorrow."
3825,0.6,0.55,0.55,"I continued to care little for shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic, story-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer."
3826,0.55,0.55,0.5,"It was a good life, if surreal."
3827,0.375,0.5,0.5,But I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.
3828,0.55,0.55,0.55,Fact: Some places are timeless.
3829,0.4175,0.4175,0.5425,"Days passed, weeks passed, but I couldn't tell if it had been months or years since I was rescued."
3830,0.5,0.5,0.55,"All there was, all I remembered, was a blur."
3831,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Gathering for drinks in the parlors, playing dress up with all the fine clothes I found in the closets (some of it modern, some of it period dress for special themed events), idling in the lounges."
3832,0.25,0.625,0.375,"So when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn't keep the air in, I heard nothing."
3833,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Now and then, a new face mingled in the crowd."
3834,0.3325,0.5,0.4175,"Other faces washed out, fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines."
3835,0.65,0.65,0.55,"One of these evenings, we were gathered in the South Ballroom for post-dinner drinks, lounging on couches and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor."
3836,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,(The 'South' was in the title to suggest that there were more ballrooms.
3837,0.5,0.3325,0.5425,'South'
3838,0.5,0.55,0.55,There weren't.)
3839,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Sarah's circle had picked up another newcomer, Adrienne, a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on Earth, let alone work on the ship in whose wreck Jefferson had found her."
3840,0.25,0.65,0.4,My first thought: I was going crazy.
3841,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Maybe it was her curiosity, asking a question I should have asked long before, that turned the conversation serious; maybe there was just something special about that evening."
3842,0.4575,0.5,0.5425,"Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating noises now?"
3843,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life, hitting some threshold or some breaking point."
3844,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Regardless, when Adrienne asked what the ship's purpose was, we all gave it a measure of thought."
3845,0.5,0.5,0.55,"We dredged up half-fledged theories and inchoate explanations, tossing these out the same way we pitched ideas about the art films."
3846,0.4175,0.5,0.4575,"“I believe we'll see the end of the universe,”"
3847,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"“I believe we'll see the end of the universe,” said Tiffany."
3848,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Captain's cohort, she had a glass of orange-brown liquid in one hand; it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor."
3849,0.5,0.55,0.55,She swirled it speculatively.
3850,0.5,0.4175,0.6675,I watched Adrienne.
3851,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,"“Impossible,”"
3852,0.4,0.4,0.5,“We can't live that long.”
3853,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,”"
3854,0.4,0.6,0.55,"“Maybe the universe will end sooner than you think,” said Jefferson."
3855,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Yeah, the captain was there, with the rest of us."
3856,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He didn't drink, but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques."
3857,0.5625,0.5,0.5,"“Maybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,”"
3858,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"“Maybe we'll travel at the speed of light and we won't age,” said Sarah, setting her wine glass on the little round end table by her couch."
3859,0.5625,0.5,0.5,“Maybe we're already traveling at the speed of light.”
3860,0.5825,0.5825,0.5425,"Tiffany, she nodded eagerly."
3861,0.5,0.625,0.625,“Relatively says it all.”
3862,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,Zheng scoffed.
3863,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,“Also impossible.
3864,0.44999999999999996,0.7,0.44999999999999996,"“Also impossible. Even if we were traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed of light—that's assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible, because it isn't—we'd still age. We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.”"
3865,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Even if we were traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed of light—that's assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible, because it isn't—we'd still age."
3866,0.5,0.5,0.6675,We'd just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us.”
3867,0.5,0.5,0.5,“And?”
3868,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,said Sarah.
3869,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“Aging is relative, anyway."
3870,0.55,0.5,0.55,"“Aging is relative, anyway. Besides, I wouldn't mind being around forever. Give our ancestors purpose. Keep their dreams alive.”"
3871,0.6,0.6,0.5,"Besides, I wouldn't mind being around forever."
3872,0.5,0.5,0.5,Give our ancestors purpose.
3873,0.75,0.6675,0.5,"“New hypothesis,”"
3874,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“New hypothesis,” suggested Kishori, slipping into the conversation."
3875,0.4,0.5,0.5,“No one's immortal.
3876,0.4,0.55,0.4,"“No one's immortal. In fact, the opposite: We're all going to die.”"
3877,0.25,0.6,0.4,"In fact, the opposite: We're all going to die.”"
3878,0.375,0.5,0.4375,"“Bleak,”"
3879,0.4575,0.3325,0.4175,"“Bleak,” commented Zheng."
3880,0.7,0.5,0.5,“But I like it.”
3881,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Ray took a drink from his glass of ice water, and shook his head."
3882,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Kishori gestured to the bar, the carpets, the paintings."
3883,0.5625,0.5,0.5,“All the luxuries money can buy.”
3884,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Tiffany took a drink, thinking."
3885,0.8,0.65,0.65,"“All the luxuries money can buy,”"
3886,0.625,0.625,0.625,"“All the luxuries money can buy,” she echoed."
3887,0.5,0.5,0.5,"And accompanying the bell, I saw a light."
3888,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“Paid for how?”
3889,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"“Smuggling,”"
3890,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"“Smuggling,” responded Kishori."
3891,0.5,0.5,0.5825,Matter-of-fact.
3892,0.65,0.5,0.55,"Jefferson snorted, amused."
3893,0.5,0.55,0.65,"“Think about it,”"
3894,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“Think about it,” Kishori continued, “where else would we get the money to buy all this?”"
3895,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.5,“Renegade smugglers.
3896,0.4575,0.6675,0.5425,"“Renegade smugglers. So what's our cargo, eh, captain?”"
3897,0.5,0.5,0.5,"So what's our cargo, eh, captain?”"
3898,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Zheng joked, leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine."
3899,0.5,0.5,0.55,Jefferson shook his head and stood up.
3900,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"“I'll leave you to your speculation,”"
3901,0.5,0.55,0.55,"“I'll leave you to your speculation,” he said."
3902,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense."
3903,0.6,0.6,0.55,A chorus of good nights followed him out the door.
3904,0.5,0.5,0.5,"After the captain left, Zheng leaned in."
3905,0.35,0.6,0.6,"“We're revolting,”"
3906,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"“We're revolting,” he told us."
3907,0.4,0.55,0.55,“And I don't mean that you disgust me.
3908,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"No, we're the start of a rebellion."
3909,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Did you hear what the captain said earlier?
3910,0.4,0.55,0.5,The universe as we know it won't be the same.”
3911,0.16749999999999998,0.5,0.3325,"“That's dumb,”"
3912,0.25,0.75,0.75,"“That's dumb,” said Sarah."
3913,0.5,0.5,0.4,“Wouldn't we know it if we were part of a rebellion?
3914,0.5,0.5,0.5,Zheng shook his head.
3915,0.55,0.55,0.55,“The captain selected us for a reason.
3916,0.55,0.35,0.44999999999999996,“The captain selected us for a reason. He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us? He knows about us.”
3917,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,He has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us?
3918,0.5,0.5,0.4375,He knows about us.”
3919,0.35,0.5,0.5,"“That's still dumb,” said Sarah."
3920,0.5,0.625,0.625,“Inside intelligence?
3921,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"“Inside intelligence? Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information.”"
3922,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Don't you remember, there's not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information.”"
3923,0.5,0.5,0.5,"First, the whole in-a-vacuum why's-there-a-bell thing."
3924,0.6,0.6,0.6,"“I still like my idea,”"
3925,0.35,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Jefferson didn't share how he found people.
3926,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"He didn't share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were, or why he saved some people but not others."
3927,0.5,0.5,0.5,"But then again, no one asked."
3928,0.5,0.4,0.5,"I guess we all figured, he knew what he was doing."
3929,0.5,0.4,0.5,He had been at this savior business longer than any of us.
3930,0.5,0.5,0.5,I wondered if Adrienne would ask about that.
3931,0.4,0.6,0.4,"Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright."
3932,0.6675,0.5825,0.6675,"“We're going to mean something,”"
3933,0.55,0.55,0.55,"“What we do, rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us, we're going to leave a legacy.”"
3934,0.5,0.5,0.625,He sounded certain.
3935,0.6,0.55,0.6,"Enthusiastic, even."
3936,0.4575,0.4575,0.5425,"Ray, he shook his head, and broke the quiet he'd held most of the evening."
3937,0.4,0.6,0.65,“You've got it all wrong.”
3938,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"He looked from Sarah, to Adrienne, to Zheng, to Kishori and Tiffany, to me."
3939,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“Obviously, we can't last longer than the rest of the universe."
3940,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.55,We aren't giving anyone purpose.
3941,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,We're not even going to leave a legacy.
3942,0.5,0.55,0.55,All we're doing is existing.
3943,0.4,0.5,0.55,"All we're doing is eating and drinking and shitting, breathing and fucking and nothing important, ever."
3944,0.35,0.5,0.44999999999999996,We aren't special.”
3945,0.35,0.65,0.5,"“Again, bleak,”"
3946,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“Again, bleak,” commented Zheng."
3947,0.5,0.5,0.5,Adrienne gestured for him to be quiet.
3948,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"She leaned forward, setting her elbows on the foot stool in front of her."
3949,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,"“You never know when it will end,”"
3950,0.3125,0.625,0.5625,"“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget."
3951,0.30000000000000004,0.7,0.4,"“You can't hold on forever, even if you don't ever, ever want to forget. How long until the memories slip away? How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people? When your life, the reason you lived, the people and faces and places, the emotions you felt, who and what you loved, when all that is gone, faded, what will you have left?”"
3952,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,How long until the memories slip away?
3953,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"How long until all you remember is this, the ship, the thick red carpeting, the chandeliers, the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people?"
3954,0.5,0.5,0.5,I wondered how long Ray had been on this ship.
3955,0.5,0.55,0.35,"I wanted to ask, but he was still talking, and I was too self-conscious to interrupt."
3956,0.5,0.55,0.55,"“You can try to hold on,”"
3957,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"“You can try to hold on,” said Ray."
3958,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,“You can try and try and try.
3959,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Repeat stories to yourself in the artificial night, sketch faces in your mind."
3960,0.4,0.5,0.5,"But words, if you repeat them enough times, lose their meaning."
3961,0.55,0.4,0.6,Emily emily em-ill-ee em-i-lee eh-mill-ee eh-mih-lee.
3962,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"My wife's name, once."
3963,0.55,0.5,0.5,These signals were the heralds of my saviors.
3964,0.4,0.4,0.5,"Repeat it enough times, it's just a sound."
3965,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,No longer grounded.”
3966,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Ray, he said, “If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us."
3967,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“If we last forever, if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out, it won't mean a thing to us. We won't care that we're last and we won't care that there are no more stars. We aren't angels. We're just dumb and lucky.”"
3968,0.4175,0.5,0.6675,We aren't angels.
3969,0.5,0.6,0.55,"“Pure dumb luck,” he said."
3970,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“Struck a nerve, huh?”"
3971,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,said Zheng.
3972,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Sorry,”"
3973,0.4,0.5,0.5,"“Sorry,” said Ray."
3974,0.5,0.3325,0.4175,“How long ago was that?”
3975,0.5,0.16749999999999998,0.5,asked Adrienne.
3976,0.375,0.5,0.5,"“Leaving your wife, I mean."
3977,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"“Leaving your wife, I mean. Traveling on this ship.”"
3978,0.6,0.65,0.55,Traveling on this ship.”
3979,0.4575,0.4575,0.5425,"Ray, he looked down at his hands, folded together in his lap, fingers interlaced."
3980,0.5,0.375,0.5,"“I don't know,” he said."
3981,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,We were all quiet for a moment.
3982,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Ray shrugged, then got up and left."
3983,0.55,0.4,0.55,We let him go.
3984,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.35,Self-conscious.
3985,0.4175,0.5825,0.4175,"More excuses were made, and after a few moments, only Adrienne and I were left sitting in the ballroom."
3986,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,She looked across the circle of couches at me.
3987,0.6675,0.5825,0.5,“What's your theory?”
3988,0.5,0.5,0.5,she asked me.
3989,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,I shrugged.
3990,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,“How long have you been here?”
3991,0.55,0.5,0.5,I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing.
3992,0.5,0.5825,0.5,"“Not that long,”"
3993,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“Not that long,” I said."
3994,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“A couple weeks, I guess."
3995,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“A couple weeks, I guess. Maybe a month or two.”"
3996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Maybe a month or two.”
3997,0.5,0.5625,0.5,“Why don't you know for sure?”
3998,0.5,0.4175,0.5,she asked.
3999,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,I shrugged.
4000,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,I hadn't been counting days.
4001,0.5,0.4,0.6,“What did you do before this? How were you found?”
4002,0.5,0.55,0.6,How were you found?”
4003,0.5425,0.4575,0.5425,“I was an engineer.”
4004,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"I explained how my ship had malfunctioned, no warning at all."
4005,0.4,0.6,0.4,"The explosions, the impossible rescue."
4006,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,She nodded.
4007,0.5,0.625,0.625,"“The ship I was on, I guess that's what happened, too."
4008,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Some vital part broke, and..."
4009,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"well, boom."
4010,0.5,0.5825,0.5,It was all so fast.”
4011,0.5,0.5,0.6,"She took a sip of her drink, plain water because, she had explained earlier, she had never liked the taste of alcohol, then fixed her gaze on me."
4012,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.65,Fact: Sound is a vibration.
4013,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"“I'm going to figure it out,”"
4014,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“I'm going to figure it out,” she said."
4015,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“How and why this ship exists.
4016,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“How and why this ship exists. I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”"
4017,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"I'll figure it out, then I'm going to find a way home.”"
4018,0.25,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"I paced my room that night, unable to sleep."
4019,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"The more I thought about it, the less sense the ship made."
4020,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Worse, Adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question."
4021,0.55,0.5,0.5,"I had spent weeks asking nothing, contentedly getting nowhere."
4022,0.25,0.5625,0.3125,Fact: Adrienne intimidated me.
4023,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.
4024,0.55,0.5,0.55,I resolved to break the pattern.
4025,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Another evening, another chandeliered room, another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d'oevres."
4026,0.65,0.65,0.55,"The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better."
4027,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Another circle of chairs and couches, another uncomfortable question."
4028,0.5,0.55,0.5,“Has anyone ever left?”
4029,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Adrienne looked at each of us in turn.
4030,0.5,0.5,0.55,Ray exchanged a glance with Zheng.
4031,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Sarah frowned.
4032,0.4,0.4,0.5,"“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days."
4033,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"“Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Alexis in days. I assumed he was indisposed.”"
4034,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"After the first whoosh of the air being sucked away, there was lightning, but no thunder."
4035,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,I assumed he was indisposed.”
4036,0.5,0.5,0.5,Kishori nodded in agreement.
4037,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,I looked at Ray and raised an eyebrow.
4038,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,“What?”
4039,0.5,0.5825,0.5,"“Well,”"
4040,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“Well,” Ray said, slowly, “People do leave."
4041,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,“People do leave. The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same. But we see new faces.”
4042,0.5,0.4175,0.5,The approximate number of people at any given event is always the same.
4043,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.4,“You're sure it's not just some people being indisposed ? ”
4044,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.44999999999999996,"asked Adrienne, using Sarah's phrasing."
4045,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,Zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table.
4046,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,"“Keep adding people long enough, regardless, you get more overall."
4047,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"A couple people staying in their rooms, even if you switch out the people, won't make a difference.”"
4048,0.5,0.4,0.5,"He dropped the pecans back into the dish, one by one."
4049,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,“So where do they go?”
4050,0.5,0.4175,0.5,Adrienne focused on Zheng.
4051,0.5,0.5,0.625,I cut in.
4052,0.5,0.5,0.4,"“Maybe a better question is, does anyone ever come back?”"
4053,0.55,0.55,0.55,Ray and Zheng exchanged another glance.
4054,0.5,0.5,0.5,Kishori chewed her lip.
4055,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink.
4056,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,"After a moment, Ray said, “I don't think so.”"
4057,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“I don't think so.”
4058,0.5,0.55,0.55,“Are there patterns?”
4059,0.5,0.375,0.5,Adrienne asked.
4060,0.5,0.6,0.44999999999999996,“Who leaves?”
4061,0.5,0.5,0.5,I hazarded a guess.
4062,0.4,0.6,0.6,"“You don't notice, do you.”"
4063,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Sarah looked indignant.
4064,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“Of course we notice. But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”"
4065,0.5,0.5,0.55,"But... well, no one important ever disappears, so it doesn't really matter, does it.”"
4066,0.4,0.55,0.4,"I could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left, and failing."
4067,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,No one contradicted her.
4068,0.5,0.5,0.5,No one offered a different answer.
4069,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,I looked at Adrienne.
4070,0.7,0.7,0.7,Mission accomplished: Our routine insouciance had been disrupted.
4071,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The scales had tipped.
4072,0.5,0.4,0.6,(I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.)
4073,0.5,0.5,0.55,"From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same."
4074,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,“How long have you been here?”
4075,0.5825,0.5,0.5,"Sarah, she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass."
4076,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“You were here before I was,”"
4077,0.55,0.55,0.6,"“You were here before I was,” said Kishori, “and so was Tiffany.”"
4078,0.4,0.7,0.44999999999999996,"When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around."
4079,0.5,0.4,0.5,“and so was Tiffany.”
4080,0.5,0.4,0.5,I looked at Zheng; he shrugged.
4081,0.5,0.3325,0.5,“Time passes in a weird way here.
4082,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,“Time passes in a weird way here. I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that... I guess I didn't see the point.”
4083,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,I kept track for a while—thirty-eight days—but after that...
4084,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.6,I guess I didn't see the point.”
4085,0.5,0.55,0.5,Fact: Some places are timeless.
4086,0.5,0.5,0.5,“Why not?”
4087,0.5,0.5,0.55,asked Adrienne.
4088,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"“Days don't matter,”"
4089,0.35,0.5,0.5,"“Days don't matter,” he said."
4090,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"Tiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before the other woman could."
4091,0.5,0.5,0.5625,“Why are you so interested?”
4092,0.5,0.4,0.5,she asked Adrienne.
4093,0.5825,0.5825,0.5,Adrienne met her gaze.
4094,0.3325,0.75,0.5825,“I don't want to be here forever.”
4095,0.55,0.55,0.55,"“But we're not here forever,”"
4096,0.4575,0.5,0.5,"“But we're not here forever,” objected Sarah."
4097,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,“Remember?
4098,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,“Remember? Alexis left.”
4099,0.5,0.5,0.5,Alexis left.”
4100,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Disappeared,”"
4101,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“Disappeared,” I corrected her."
4102,0.35,0.4,0.4,“We don't know how or why he left.
4103,0.5,0.4,0.5,“We don't know how or why he left. Or where he went.”
4104,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Or where he went.”
4105,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Zheng looked thoughtful.
4106,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk."
4107,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"He picked up his glass, swirled the liquid around, took a sip, then set the glass back down."
4108,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.44999999999999996,He glanced around at the rest of us.
4109,0.55,0.6,0.7,“Do you want to leave?”
4110,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,he asked.
4111,0.5,0.5,0.55,“Could you live anywhere else now?”
4112,0.5625,0.625,0.75,I spoke up.
4113,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“I wouldn't miss this, much.”"
4114,0.4575,0.4175,0.5825,No one else said anything.
4115,0.5,0.6,0.44999999999999996,I watched Adrienne's eyes move from one face to the next.
4116,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Zheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense, steady gaze."
4117,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“You think that,”"
4118,0.55,0.55,0.55,"“You think that,” he said, “but is it true?"
4119,0.4375,0.5,0.5625,"“but is it true? Would you be happy back in a normal life, working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days?”"
4120,0.5,0.5,0.5,Fact: It's too easy to fall into patterns.
4121,0.5,0.375,0.5625,Fact: I wasn't sure I wanted the dream stage to end.
4122,0.375,0.5625,0.375,My quarters felt stifling.
4123,0.4,0.6,0.55,Asphyxiating my mind.
4124,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm, neck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I ruminated on the situation."
4125,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful.
4126,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"I inspected the arrays of entertainment options—abstract, old-style flatscreens, engrossing VR flicks and action games, a selection of quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity."
4127,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"There was a schedule advertising upcoming on-ship events, such as dance classes, craft sessions, and discussion groups, and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to."
4128,0.5,0.4,0.5,"A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all the lightscreen's superficial characteristics."
4129,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.65,A simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship.
4130,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,That was all.
4131,0.4,0.5,0.5,"A methodical search of my two adjoining rooms, the ample closet space, and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder."
4132,0.5,0.6,0.55,"Furniture (dark wood, expensive, polished, no secret compartments), clothes, leftover tray of half-consumed food from the previous day's lunch, toiletries (complete with miniature bottles of sweet-smelling apricot honey lotion), lightscreen, me."
4133,0.30000000000000004,0.65,0.35,I was discouraged and frustrated.
4134,0.5,0.6675,0.5825,I wanted to prove to Adrienne that I wanted solve the ship's mystery just as much as she did.
4135,0.5,0.625,0.625,"I wanted to find something, anything, that would prove all this was normal and sane."
4136,0.4375,0.375,0.5625,I didn't want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences.
4137,0.5,0.6,0.55,I wanted my contentment back.
4138,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,I cornered Adrienne at dinner that night.
4139,0.55,0.5,0.6,"In one hand I balanced my plate of star-shaped crackers, globs of elegant dips and garnishes, little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant, and an array of other delectable, bite-sized items."
4140,0.55,0.55,0.65,My other hand pointedly steered Adrienne to a small table against a wall.
4141,0.5425,0.5,0.5825,"She glared at me, but obediently let me pull her along."
4142,0.4175,0.5,0.4175,"I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was found."
4143,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"“Tell me,”"
4144,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"“Tell me,” I said, after we sat, “what you have found.”"
4145,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,“what you have found.”
4146,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,It wasn't a question.
4147,0.3325,0.5825,0.4175,"She gave me a grumpy look that informed me, quite clearly, of her current opinion of me."
4148,0.2,0.6,0.5,“Not if you're going to be rude about it.”
4149,0.35,0.4,0.44999999999999996,I sighed.
4150,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,“Sorry.”
4151,0.5825,0.5,0.6675,"I wasn't, not really, but I'd lie to get the conversation going."
4152,0.5,0.55,0.65,“I want to know.”
4153,0.5,0.55,0.6,"I explained, in two brief sentences, my earlier impasse."
4154,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“I don't know much,”"
4155,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,"“I don't know much,” she said, still annoyed but at least cooperative."
4156,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"She reviewed the information gleaned from our previous dinner conversations, adding, “I heard the captain say something yesterday, as I walking to the Pyrope Parlor."
4157,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"I was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side, talking to a couple people, and they must not have known I was there."
4158,0.5,0.55,0.5,He said something about a wreck going well.
4159,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"And listen, when they came round the corner, Ray was with the captain.”"
4160,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The next time the captain stopped by our group, Tiffany tagging along (pretending that she, too, was a social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone), we were ready."
4161,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,I was now one of them.
4162,0.5,0.55,0.55,“Is there a doctor on board?”
4163,0.5,0.4,0.55,asked Adrienne.
4164,0.3325,0.5,0.5,“I've been having headaches.”
4165,0.5,0.55,0.55,"This story, it's our story."
4166,0.4175,0.4575,0.5825,"It was a lie, but we needed information."
4167,0.5,0.4,0.4,"“Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left."
4168,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"“Down past the Emerald Lounge, second door on the left. All hours.”"
4169,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,All hours.”
4170,0.5,0.5,0.5,"A robot, then."
4171,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Medical AI were even more expensive than the barkeep.
4172,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill?
4173,0.3125,0.375,0.4375,"The survivors of the unfortunate accidents, the catastrophic malfunctions, the fateful crashes: this is us."
4174,0.5,0.5,0.5,“Does he age?”
4175,0.5,0.5,0.5,asked Adrienne.
4176,0.5,0.55,0.55,“The captain?”
4177,0.5,0.25,0.5,“I never thought about it.”
4178,0.5,0.5825,0.4175,Adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face.
4179,0.5,0.35,0.5,>Hotel California
4180,0.4175,0.6675,0.5,"“That doesn't answer my question,”"
4181,0.4,0.5,0.55,"“That doesn't answer my question,” she said."
4182,0.5,0.5,0.4175,asked Kishori sympathetically.
4183,0.25,0.55,0.7,"“No,”"
4184,0.3325,0.75,0.6675,"“No,” said Adrienne."
4185,0.55,0.4,0.55,"“At least have a drink,”"
4186,0.5,0.55,0.6,"“At least have a drink,” said Sarah."
4187,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,“I find it takes the edge off.”
4188,0.4,0.6,0.55,"“Maybe that's the problem,”"
4189,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"“Maybe that's the problem,” said Sarah."
4190,0.55,0.55,0.5,"“One hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,”"
4191,0.55,0.55,0.5,"“One hundred and forty-seven is a magic number,” said Sarah."
4192,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,“You ever heard of Dunbar?
4193,0.65,0.6,0.6,"“You ever heard of Dunbar? Well, we've got the perfect-size group right here.”"
4194,0.625,0.5,0.5425,"Well, we've got the perfect-size group right here.”"
4195,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Just enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other.
4196,0.4,0.5,0.55,“Why doesn't anyone mutiny?”
4197,0.5,0.5,0.5,Adrienne asked.
4198,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.7,"“If you dislike this place so much, why don't you do something about it?”"
4199,0.35,0.55,0.55,"“We can't,”"
4200,0.5,0.4175,0.4575,“What would we do?”
4201,0.2,0.7,0.4,Adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust.
4202,0.5,0.6,0.75,“You could force the captain to set down somewhere.
4203,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.65,"“You could force the captain to set down somewhere. Let us off the ship. If he refuses, threaten him. If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there someone who can drive a ship?”"
4204,0.55,0.55,0.6,Let us off the ship.
4205,0.3125,0.5625,0.6875,"If he refuses, threaten him."
4206,0.5,0.6,0.6,"If he still refuses, well, of all of us, isn't there someone who can drive a ship?”"
4207,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Floating alone, each of us facing the silence of the vacuum, we were found."
4208,0.25,0.75,0.65,"“That's murder,”"
4209,0.4,0.55,0.55,"“That's murder,” objected Sarah."
4210,0.5,0.4,0.65,"“That's survival, ”"
4211,0.4175,0.5825,0.5,"“That's survival, ” Adrienne corrected her."
4212,0.25,0.7,0.6,“Do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life?”
4213,0.65,0.5,0.5,"I shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the Emerald Lounge, looking out the windows at the stars."
4214,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"Times like that, running on less sleep than I should, alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night, I had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it."
4215,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"The stillness of the room contributed, as did the view."
4216,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"Black and more black, speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to break the emptiness, if only for a brief time."
4217,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"All of it was temporary, save for the black."
4218,0.5,0.4,0.55,That was tonight's melodramatic theme: the ephemeral nature of life.
4219,0.5825,0.5,0.5825,"Once found, we can never be lost."
4220,0.55,0.55,0.5,Everything temporary.
4221,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"Everything to fade away, lost as dust and scattered atoms between the stars, and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born."
4222,0.3325,0.6675,0.3325,"Eyes bulging in panic, but no screams."
4223,0.4575,0.5425,0.5425,"Some things in this world, we have to make them permanent ourselves."
4224,0.5,0.4,0.6,This is our Hotel California.
4225,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,He had made us a constant.
4226,0.5,0.5,0.55,He made this ship—this life—a constant.
4227,0.5,0.3325,0.4575,The one thing that was known.
4228,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,The one thing that wouldn't change.
4229,0.375,0.5,0.375,We can never leave.
4230,0.4575,0.375,0.5425,"But ultimately, this ship, its purpose, our purpose—did it matter?"
4231,0.5,0.5,0.5,Maybe that was enough.
4232,0.5,0.375,0.375,"And all of us, we were permanent characters in each others' stories."
4233,0.5,0.5625,0.5,"“So, I'm on a ship now?"
4234,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"“So, I'm on a ship now? You do this a lot?”"
4235,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Maybe that made us more real.
4236,0.4375,0.4375,0.4375,Maybe it made us feel less alone.
4237,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,“Mind if I join you?”
4238,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,I turned to see Adrienne in the doorway.
4239,0.6875,0.625,0.5625,"She smiled, then crossed the room to join me by the window, not waiting for an answer."
4240,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Some nights,”"
4241,0.25,0.4175,0.3325,"“I can't see the meaning in any of it. All these things I do, they're just to pass the time until I die.”"
4242,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"All these things I do, they're just to pass the time until I die.”"
4243,0.4,0.4,0.6,"“You don't see a meaning because there is no meaning,”"
4244,0.5,0.6,0.5,"“You don't see a meaning because there is no meaning,” she said."
4245,0.4575,0.4575,0.4575,"After all of it, as much as we feared being alone, we feared being vulnerable even more."
4246,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,Our instinct was to hide.
4247,0.5625,0.5,0.4375,"“Look what I found,”"
4248,0.55,0.65,0.5,"“Look what I found,” Adrienne said."
4249,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,In her hands was a bottle.
4250,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Jefferson was in the Captain's Lounge,"
4251,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.5,Fact: Sound is a vibration.
4252,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“Up his dosage,”"
4253,0.5,0.55,0.5,"“Up his dosage,” I heard the captain say."
4254,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,I ran.
4255,0.4,0.5,0.55,I didn't want to forget.
4256,0.25,0.55,0.5,I didn't want to be harvested.
4257,0.5,0.55,0.55,"The last thing I remember, I was tearing down the corridors."
4258,0.5,0.5,0.5,“Now and then.”
4259,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Life boats, I thought."
4260,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Every ship had life boats.
4261,0.5,0.55,0.6,"In case of emergency, break glass."
4262,0.55,0.55,0.55,I'd find one.
4263,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,“What about my crewmates?
4264,0.4,0.55,0.55,“What about my crewmates? Why didn't you save them?”
4265,0.5,0.5,0.5,A space station.
4266,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,Some other ship.
4267,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,Any place but this place.
4268,0.3325,0.5825,0.3325,"Failing all else, I'd suffocate."
4269,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.35,Alone.
4270,0.4,0.55,0.5,"Ray, he caught me as I pounded on the corridor walls, finding no glass to break."
4271,0.65,0.35,0.5,"“Relax,”"
4272,0.2,0.65,0.25,"“Relax,” he told me, sliding a needle into my arm."
4273,0.5,0.5,0.4175,Why didn't you save them?”
4274,0.6,0.6,0.55,"“It'll pass,” he told me."
4275,0.6,0.6,0.55,He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing.
4276,0.5,0.4175,0.5,It passed.
4277,0.35,0.55,0.30000000000000004,I can never leave.
4278,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.55,"As much as Jesse had irritated me, I didn't like the picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave, body swollen and bloated."
4279,0.65,0.6,0.5,"Quiet and peaceful, right?"
4280,0.35,0.55,0.5,Who would tell his girl how he had died?
4281,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"“Couldn't,”"
4282,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“Couldn't,” said the captain."
4283,0.55,0.6,0.65,"Jefferson, he called himself, clean-shaven and smart, a picture of the perfect entrepreneur."
4284,0.5,0.55,0.65,"“We're selective about our passengers,”"
4285,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“We're selective about our passengers,” he continued."
4286,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,Such a relief to never again hear my crewmate Jesse natter about his girl back on Earth and that all-expenses-paid vacation-for-two she won last time he was on leave.
4287,0.5,0.4,0.55,“You fit the bill.
4288,0.5,0.55,0.5,“You fit the bill. They didn't.”
4289,0.375,0.5,0.5,They didn't.”
4290,0.5625,0.5,0.5,"Tiffany, she looked at the captain, grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder."
4291,0.5,0.5,0.5,She turned to me.
4292,0.5,0.5625,0.5625,"“Come on,”"
4293,0.55,0.55,0.4,"“Come on,” she said, before I could say anything else, “let's get you settled in.”"
4294,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.5,“let's get you settled in.”
4295,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.7,No time for questions.
4296,0.55,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"The ship had all the usual accoutrements (artificial gravity, tastefully painted walls, sound dampeners to keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane, recycled air systems), and a few less-usual: lush carpeting, lighting that was decorative as well as functional, spacious corridors."
4297,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The occasional painting hung on the wall (generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met, primarily)."
4298,0.55,0.55,0.5,Glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways; music; voices; the aroma of real food.
4299,0.65,0.6,0.5,This was heaven.
4300,0.5,0.55,0.55,"No seventy-two virgins, but it would do."
4301,0.5,0.4,0.5,“Where are we going?”
4302,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,I asked.
4303,0.5,0.5,0.5,Tiffany looked back.
4304,0.5,0.55,0.7,“To your quarters.
4305,0.5,0.5,0.5,“To your quarters. It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.”
4306,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.65,It's not far; you're not going to get blisters.”
4307,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“No, I meant, where's the ship going?"
4308,0.5,0.55,0.5,"“No, I meant, where's the ship going? What's our destination?”"
4309,0.5,0.4175,0.5,What's our destination?”
4310,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Tiffany, she stopped walking."
4311,0.5,0.6,0.5,"She gave me a look, pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to share the news."
4312,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,"Sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium, and in space, there is no medium."
4313,0.7,0.7,0.6,“You're going to be delighted. Destination everywhere. Destination nowhere.”
4314,0.5825,0.4575,0.4575,Destination everywhere.
4315,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Destination nowhere.”
4316,0.2,0.6,0.44999999999999996,This was hell.
4317,0.25,0.65,0.30000000000000004,"I died in those last moments, suffocating on my own exhaled breath, and this, this was my reward."
4318,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Fact: The speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees Celsius or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit is three hundred and forty-three meters per second, or one thousand one hundred twenty-five feet per second."
4319,0.55,0.55,0.55,"It took me a couple days to realize I was, in fact, still alive."
4320,0.65,0.55,0.55,"I mean, sure, I'd had my moment of elation when I had first realized I'd been rescued, but it didn't sink in."
4321,0.4,0.55,0.5,"I swore, if I ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again, giving the camera a cheesy thumbs-up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches, I'd kiss a monkey."
4322,0.5,0.25,0.5,"The lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official meals were taking place, but I hadn't bothered to acknowledge the invitations."
4323,0.35,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"It hadn't seemed relevant, somehow, given that I was still reeling over the explosion, the deaths of my crewmates, and the rescue."
4324,0.25,0.6,0.5,I've heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock; I guess I was working my way through them.
4325,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Initially, I couldn't figure out why—I hadn't requested any be sent."
4326,0.65,0.5,0.55,"Then I realized, someone must have noticed I hadn't left, and was nice enough to send food my way."
4327,0.6675,0.5825,0.5,The accompanying bottle of wine was a nice touch.
4328,0.5,0.5,0.4175,"I must have consumed it, too, because later on, the plates and the bottle were both empty."
4329,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"I spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed, staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling, or slumped in the old-fashioned armchair, staring out the windows at the stars."
4330,0.7,0.5,0.55,"Man, was it good to be done with that stage."
4331,0.25,0.7,0.6,It was time to find out what hell looked like.
4332,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,Fact: Hell is other people.
4333,0.65,0.6,0.55,"Sure, the ship was spacious."
4334,0.55,0.55,0.6,"But we were all on this ship, and we were on it together."
4335,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.44999999999999996,Cliques form in any decent-sized group of people.
4336,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Metaphorically, of course."
4337,0.5,0.625,0.5,"Me, I was singled out by Sarah, an unassuming forty-something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the other."
4338,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,She sidled up to me as I was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro cream dip onto a plate.
4339,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Fact: If, before all the air is sucked out of the ship, a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit, that person has less than twenty-four hours to live."
4340,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"The plate, by the way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish, paprika-dusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of meat smothered in a tomato-based sauce."
4341,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Luxurious, even compared to the fare one would find in the high-class space stations and pleasure cruisers."
4342,0.6875,0.6875,0.5625,"Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it was mouthwateringly, lip-smackingly gorgeous."
4343,0.6,0.6,0.5,I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing.
4344,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,I decided it couldn't have been.
4345,0.6875,0.5,0.6875,"“Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh? I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”"
4346,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"I'm Sarah, and this is Alexis—you must be the new pickup.”"
4347,0.5,0.5625,0.4375,She looked me over approvingly.
4348,0.6,0.5,0.7,"“Come on, let's get you a glass of champagne.”"
4349,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"I looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar, but didn't protest."
4350,0.5,0.5,0.55,The bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot.
4351,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It turned toward Sarah's wave and acknowledged her with a nod, moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her."
4352,0.5825,0.4575,0.5425,I marveled at the robot's smoothness and coordination.
4353,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Clearly, it was a high-end model."
4354,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions, with Alexis trailing after us."
4355,0.5,0.5,0.4175,"I spent the evening listening, mostly."
4356,0.55,0.55,0.5,Listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided.
4357,0.5,0.5,0.6,No one minded; Sarah's inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter.
4358,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Ray, a plump man who was grey where he wasn't bald."
4359,0.55,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"Zheng, short and dark and lean, with a very intense gaze."
4360,0.30000000000000004,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,He made me a little uncomfortable.
4361,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Kishori, petite, her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist."
4362,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,"I categorized them based on their appearances, hoping I'd be able to pick them out of the crowd again later."
4363,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,This is more than the person would have sans space suit.
4364,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day-to-day activities, how so-and-so had been seen in so-and-so's table at lunch and my wasn't that a surprise, and why hadn't the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night, but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on Earth, didn't they, and this was somehow an interesting fact."
4365,0.5,0.35,0.55,"After the first half-hour, I stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight."
4366,0.6,0.55,0.6,"Pretty cool, right?"
4367,0.6,0.6,0.55,Google TGI Friday's Fan Woody and it looks pretty good.
4368,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.44999999999999996,But then something not so awesome happened.
4369,0.55,0.55,0.55,All those fans wanted their free burgers and they wanted them now!
4370,0.4,0.6,0.55,TGI Friday's completely lost control of the page and eventually doled out a lot of free burgers.
4371,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.65,Now from a short term perspective I'm sure they did ok on the deal.
4372,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,People came in and ate their food.
4373,0.5,0.5,0.5,"But they could have accomplished that with coupons in the mail, the newspaper or by an email list."
4374,0.5,0.5,0.5,But they decided to go the Social Media route.
4375,0.6,0.75,0.65,"Now, let's take a look at what the Friday's FanWoody Facebook page looks like today: Whoops!"
4376,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Apparently Woody and his 900,000+ fans went poof ."
4377,0.375,0.5,0.375,How come?
4378,0.5,0.4,0.55,I'm guessing it had something to do with the venom and general anarchy the page had created by buying fans rather than growing them.
4379,0.5,0.5,0.5,"A TGI Friday's Facebook page does exist, with roughly a third of the fans they used to have."
4380,0.35,0.6,0.55,"TGI Friday's pretty much had to spray Agent Orange on their relationship with 600,000 people."
4381,0.5,0.55,0.55,I think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of Facebook ads.
4382,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"The ability to target your demo is really terrific, but you're in danger of creating a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a ""what have you done for me lately"" foundation."
4383,0.5,0.5,0.75,"First, you essentially bought these fans."
4384,0.5,0.625,0.5625,You paid Facebook for the right to target them.
4385,0.4,0.55,0.5,"Walls filled with off topic conversations at best, vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst."
4386,0.4375,0.5625,0.5625,"Then in the case of TGI Friday's or other brands that offer free product or discount coupons, you are essentially buying them again."
4387,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"This sets up a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with a tangible item, that is, free stuff."
4388,0.5425,0.5,0.5,"That's not a bonus item, it's now a standard part of the agreement."
4389,0.55,0.6,0.55,Want me as a fan?
4390,0.5,0.6,0.8,Give me free stuff.
4391,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"The point of Social Media isn't to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons, often free / discounted product is the least of these reasons."
4392,0.4175,0.4575,0.5425,"I'm not saying that special bonuses, or 'surprise and delight' offers aren't ever a good thing."
4393,0.5,0.5,0.5,I think when used properly they can be terrific.
4394,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,What do I mean by used properly?
4395,0.5,0.5,0.5,As a reward for people who have engaged with the brand in a meaningful way.
4396,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"Send us a picture of you wearing a brand t-shirt and sure, you've earned a free sandwich."
4397,0.6875,0.5,0.625,Recruit some friends and I'm happy to give you all some coupons.
4398,0.5825,0.5,0.5,But when fans enter the relationship feeling they are entitled to free samples and you're in trouble.
4399,0.5,0.5,0.5,What happened?
4400,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Kathy Sharpe says: April 18, 2010 at 1:02 pm"
4401,0.6,0.55,0.55,About time there was some acknowledgement of the true value of fans.
4402,0.4575,0.4575,0.5425,Even if you have 3 million+ fans and they are all well behaved citizens what is the real marketing value?
4403,0.5,0.4,0.5,Wasn't having thousands of fans supposed to be a good thing?
4404,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Facebook Fans: You Get What You Pay For 24 Mar 2010 by Rick
4405,0.7,0.65,0.5,"Sure, it's great having several hundred thousands fans."
4406,0.55,0.55,0.6,But how did you come to get those fans?
4407,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Did you earn them through fantastic customer service, fulfilling the brand promise, providing value to the community in an authentic and passionate voice, or did you run a Facebook ad campaign and hit the broadcast airwaves with a promotion?"
4408,0.25,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Take a look at the Facebook Fan Pages of some brands and what you see is not a pretty picture.
4409,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Let's look at   my old favorite , TGI Friday's: If you can see this, then you might need a Flash Player upgrade or you need to install Flash Player if it's missing."
4410,0.5,0.375,0.5825,Get Flash Player from Adobe.
4411,0.55,0.6,0.6,Remember that ad?
4412,0.65,0.6,0.6,"Sure, Shaquille O'Neal once said,  ""I've won at every level but college and pro,"" but Shaq was always a larger than life (literally) character who was outgoing and had a great relationship with fans."
4413,0.7,0.65,0.7,"""I've won at every level but college and pro,"""
4414,0.65,0.6,0.65,That's one of the reasons  Shaq's been a huge hit on Twitter .
4415,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,I think an appropriate comparison might be Alex Rodriguez.
4416,0.4,0.65,0.55,"By making his announcement in this public way, Lebron has only heaped more pressure on himself."
4417,0.4,0.6,0.6,"Ask A-Rod how the media can turn on you when you put yourself above your teammates, above the game."
4418,0.5,0.5,0.5,James now finds himself in the following position:
4419,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,1. Winning a title is expected immediately wherever he goes
4420,0.4375,0.5,0.5,2. Not winning a title will be seen as a massive disappointment
4421,0.5,0.375,0.625,3. Winning a title will result in some saying that he couldn't do it alone
4422,0.375,0.5425,0.4175,"4. He's put himself in a position where if he leaves Cleveland, every other city (and Cleveland) will be rooting against him"
4423,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Sounds just like Alex Rodriguez, doesn't it?"
4424,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"I'm no longer the target demographic for most of the products Lebron endorses, but you know what matters to me?"
4425,0.7,0.65,0.65,Winning championships.
4426,0.4375,0.5,0.5,"Not live prime time press conferences, not self-aggrandizing twitter hashtags and not quitting on his teammates during the playoffs."
4427,0.5,0.4,0.55,"We know he'll be rich, but how will he be viewed by fans across the country."
4428,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.6,Perhaps Lebron should have hired a  Chief Culture Officer along with his coterie of other advisors.
4429,0.55,0.55,0.6,"If I were to fulfill that role for him, I would have told him to go low key with this decision and let it be led by his new team."
4430,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"He's also managed to surround himself with people who understand business, but I'm starting to wonder if he's lost a bit of understanding of American culture."
4431,0.55,0.6,0.65,That the only thing that matters is winning a championship.
4432,0.5,0.375,0.5,That that was the main factor.
4433,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Update:  Lebron chooses the Miami Heat and the similarities to A-Rod continue, with Dwyane Wade playing the role of Derek Jeter."
4434,0.5,0.5,0.5,Update 2: And so it begins...
4435,0.5,0.5,0.5,One Comment
4436,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Dan Winkler says: July 9, 2010 at 1:29 am"
4437,0.5,0.5,0.5,Heatenfreude?
4438,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"Lebron didn't play college basketball, he went straight from high school to the pros, and since joining the Cleveland Cavaliers he's won exactly zero NBA champions."
4439,0.5,0.5,0.5,How soon is now? Lebron James Makes His Decision: The A-Rod Route 8 Jul 2010 by Rick
4440,0.6,0.65,0.6,Earlier this week Lebron jumped on Twitter and quickly gained a massive following.
4441,0.55,0.5,0.5,This morning he announced:
4442,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,Lebron James was of course a trending topic and that hashtag was burning as well.
4443,0.55,0.55,0.55,Lebron James is an extremely talented basketball player.
4444,0.5,0.5,0.4375,"But I'm starting to wonder if Lebron isn't painting himself into a corner, and has maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change."
4445,0.25,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Still others are less obvious but just as horrible; dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers; baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk-fed” veal for the gourmet; and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen.
4446,0.5,0.5,0.5,“milk-fed”
4447,0.4575,0.5,0.4175,“accidental”
4448,0.3325,0.5825,0.5,"And almost 6,000,000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout America."
4449,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"What is even more shocking, is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel, painful deaths each year ..."
4450,0.15000000000000002,0.75,0.44999999999999996,needless deaths that could have been stopped!
4451,0.35,0.55,0.5,"And with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on, I’m sure you can understand why the work of The Humane Society of the United States is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people, like you, to help us bring an end to animal suffering, abuse and neglect."
4452,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Since 1954, our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties."
4453,0.75,0.5,0.625,"We also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local, state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty."
4454,0.625,0.5,0.625,Your name -- and the name of The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) -- are very important to the well-being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives.
4455,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"Our primary goal, though, has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens, so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering, abuse and exploitation."
4456,0.4375,0.5625,0.4375,"But while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty, we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources."
4457,0.5,0.55,0.6,"It’s a difficult problem, because we have to fight the well-financed and powerful agri-business and research industries, but we do our best to protect the animals."
4458,0.5,0.375,0.375,And that’s where you can help.
4459,0.6675,0.5825,0.5825,You can be a lifesaving “friend” to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of The HSUS and asking them to become vigilant in safe-guarding the lives of ALL animals.
4460,0.55,0.5,0.5,“friend”
4461,0.5,0.5,0.5425,"Today, we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption."
4462,0.6,0.55,0.55,"Dear Friend of Animals,"
4463,0.5,0.55,0.5,I hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home.
4464,0.5,0.4,0.5,"It’s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal, too."
4465,0.5,0.5,0.55,I also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax-deductible donation today.
4466,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Your gift of at least $5 or $10 or even $15, will help The HSUS save millions of animals."
4467,0.5825,0.6675,0.5825,I know you care deeply for the well-being of all animals.
4468,0.55,0.65,0.65,Please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated.
4469,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Sincerely, President"
4470,0.4175,0.4175,0.5825,P.S. We are totally committed to putting an end to all forms of animal cruelty and neglect.

4499,0.375,0.5,0.5425,"Too, too often, man has not been a good neighbor to animals."
4500,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Whether we talk about clubbing baby seals to death for their beautiful pelts, or butchering elephants with hacksaws for their ivory, or trapping animals in steel-jaw leghold traps where the pain is so excruciating they have been known to chew off a leg to escape, we stand guard for all animals."

4528,0.5,0.5,0.5,Prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic preservation.
4529,0.5,0.5,0.5,Dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor.
4530,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"You can view artifacts from the Bronze Age, trace the history of the Easter Rising, or revisit Leopold Bloom’s odyssey in Ulysses."
4531,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Old buildings are being recycled; for example, the 17th-century Royal Hospital now holds the Museum of Modern Art."
4532,0.5,0.5,0.5,"And Dublin, a city large in expectations, is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its sights on foot."
4533,0.35,0.65,0.5,"New construction is everywhere, the streets buzz, traffic is increasingly congested, and in the frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in Dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else."
4534,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.65,City on the Liffey
4535,0.55,0.6,0.5,The River Liffey flows from west to east through the center of the city to Dublin Bay.
4536,0.5,0.5,0.5,The river forms a natural line between the north and south sections of the city.
4537,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Historically and culturally this north-south distinction has always been significant, and it still is today, with a dose of good-humored rivalry between the two areas."
4538,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"“ I never go north of the Liffey,”"
4539,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“ I never go north of the Liffey,” one man remarked."
4540,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Farther out, both north and south, are the sweeping curves of the Royal and Grand Canals."
4541,0.5625,0.5625,0.5,"The occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that Dublin is by the sea, and the Wicklow mountains, which hold Dublin closely to the coast, are visible from everywhere."
4542,0.5825,0.4175,0.5825,"Dublin is an intimate city, physically small but tightly packed, a perfect place for walking."
4543,0.5,0.5,0.5,"College Green, the home of Trinity College, provides a natural focus just south of the O’Connell Street bridge."
4544,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Dublin and the Dubliners
4545,0.5,0.4,0.5,"O’Connell Street, the city’s grand boulevard, leads north to Parnell Square."
4546,0.5625,0.5,0.625,To the south and east is St. Stephen’s Green and Georgian Dublin where the national museums are located.
4547,0.5425,0.4175,0.5,"Along the Liffey to the west is Temple Bar, center of nightlife and home to many of Dublin’s cutting-edge artists and artistic endeavors."
4548,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Up the hill from Temple Bar are Dublin Castle and Christ Church Cathedral.
4549,0.6,0.5,0.5,It won’t rain on you in Dublin all the time.
4550,0.5,0.5625,0.5625,"The climate here can best be described as “changeable” and yet the sudden shifts from light to dark, sunshine to shower, are part of the city’s magic."
4551,0.5,0.5,0.55,Buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light; Dublin under a lowering sky is a different place from Dublin in sunshine.
4552,0.75,0.55,0.6,Enjoying Dublin
4553,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,"Joyce, the high priest of literary Modernism, imagined and interpreted Dublin for the world in Ulysses (you’ll see references to it all over)."
4554,0.65,0.65,0.6,At night the streets are crowded with people bent on having a good time.
4555,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Beckett and Joyce, among others, had to leave their homeland to understand it —  and to be understood."
4556,0.5,0.5,0.5,The city’s impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of U2 and Bob Geldof is well known — there’s even a self-guided tour of their haunts.
4557,0.5825,0.5825,0.5825,"Traditional Irish music is also alive and well, especially in the pubs, and there has been a revival of storytelling, poetry reading, and traditional dancing."
4558,0.65,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"And in this city, where literature and theater have historically dominated the scene, visual arts are finally coming into their own with the new Museum of Modern Art and the many galleries that display the work of modern Irish artists."
4559,0.6675,0.6675,0.75,Prosperity is in the air; the roar of the “Celtic Tiger” can clearly be heard.
4560,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Many shops, and also hotels and guest houses, have been owned and managed by the same families for years, and theirs is the welcome of traditional Dublin hospitality."
4561,0.5,0.5,0.5,Dublin’s food has undergone a metamorphosis.
4562,0.4,0.5,0.5,"There was a time when you might have apologized for it, but no longer."
4563,0.55,0.6,0.55,"Dublin has international restaurants galore, and the New Irish Cuisine is built upon fresh products of Ireland’s seas, rivers, and farms."
4564,0.4175,0.5825,0.5825,But this is not the whole picture.
4565,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Coffee has replaced the ubiquitous tea — Dublin is now almost as much a coffee city as Vienna or Seattle.

4567,0.5625,0.4375,0.5625,In a city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation.
4568,0.625,0.5,0.5,The proverbial hospitality and warm welcome are still here.
4569,0.625,0.5,0.5,"Phoenix Park in the northwest is the largest open space, but squares like St. Stephen’s Green are the garden oases of the city."

4582,0.5,0.5,0.5,Religion and respect for parents has not yet gone out of fashion.
4583,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,And young graduates are not leaving now — multinational corporations and European Union investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home.

4588,0.4375,0.5625,0.5625,"Today Hong Kong remains a capitalist enclave with its laws and rights intact, and China has promised that Hong Kong will continue in this fashion for at least 50 years."
4589,0.625,0.625,0.625,Beijing’s announced policy of maintaining Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability makes sense.
4590,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Hong Kong has long been China’s handiest window on the West, and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know-how and managerial expertise."
4591,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Around the time of the transition there was much speculation about how things would change.

4606,0.5,0.5,0.5,"But it is also efficient, with one of the best transportation systems anywhere, and for such a crowded place, quiet — you don’t hear voices raised in anger, motorists sitting on their horns, or loud boomboxes."
4607,0.5,0.375,0.4575,"Old customs are still followed: Fate and luck are taken very seriously, and astrologers and fortune-tellers do a steady business."

4620,0.5425,0.4575,0.5425,"Exciting, mysterious, glamorous — these words have described Hong Kong for at least a century."
4621,0.55,0.55,0.5,"You’ll find Hong Kong easy to get around, the people helpful, English spoken everywhere, and food that lives up to its reputation."

4624,0.375,0.375,0.5,"But this post isn't about how melancholy I become when I haven't heard from her by 3 p.m. (which would be midnight over there), because anyone who follows me on Facebook already knows that and because this post concerns Urbino, not my daily descent into emo."
4625,0.3325,0.4175,0.4575,"As you probably noticed, my wife is currently on vacation without me -— which is different than a vacation from me, although given how frequently insufferable I am, I could understand the appeal of such—in the le Marche region of Italy, which is immediately south of Tuscany and full of communists."
4626,0.55,0.6,0.55,"I've written about Urbino before , but because the wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs of the city, I feel compelled to do so again."

4842,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"She is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised, but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature."
4843,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories.
4844,0.5,0.55,0.6,This is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films - she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored.
4845,0.4175,0.4175,0.5425,"In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda."

4863,0.5,0.5,0.5,"While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale’s transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it."

4903,0.3125,0.5,0.5625,"The cause - undetermined, but the suspected culprit is pollution poisoning our oceans with toxic chemicals and sewage."
4904,0.5,0.55,0.5,“I will help you find your Rachel.
4905,0.25,0.75,0.6675,"I have to warn you, though, you won’t like what I have to tell you.”"
4906,0.5,0.5,0.5825,Something in his tone couldn’t be disbelieved.
4907,0.5,0.6,0.75,“Tell me anyway.
4908,0.5,0.5825,0.5,"If she’s in trouble, I want to find her, wherever she is.”"
4909,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,My driver took a deep breath.
4910,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"As he did, his neck stretched in a strange way and I noticed several thin lines, like wrinkles, running across the sides of his neck."
4911,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"“Nathan,”"
4912,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,"“Nathan,” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation,"
4913,0.4,0.6,0.5,“Rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet.
4914,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"This person, like me, is not a member of traditional society."
4915,0.35,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"You see, Nathan, there is …separate from your society …oh, damn it."
4916,0.5,0.5625,0.5,I’ve never had to give this conversation before.
4917,0.5,0.55,0.65,"Come on, I have something to show you.”"
4918,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"With that, he made a sharp turn onto a side street that I hadn’t noticed before."
4919,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,We drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that I couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned.
4920,0.5,0.4175,0.5,My driver turned again next to an old warehouse that I might have been in once when Mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year.
4921,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.65,"In front of a few houses, there were cars parked, but there were almost none on the streets."
4922,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Their bumpers looked ready to drop off, and their paint was half smog."
4923,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,I got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here.
4924,0.5,0.6,0.5,"“Hey,”"
4925,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,"“Hey,” I said, “are you sure that we should be going this way?"
4926,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,“are you sure that we should be going this way?
4927,0.5,0.4,0.55,I mean – ”
4928,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"“Just ignore that,”"
4929,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,"“Just ignore that,” he told me."
4930,0.5,0.5,0.5,“You’ll be used to the sensation in a moment.”
4931,0.25,0.7,0.30000000000000004,That just unnerved me more.
4932,0.35,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"As we kept driving, the anxiety grew more pronounced."
4933,0.5,0.5,0.5,My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school.
4934,0.5,0.5,0.5,"I noticed that there were some people on the street, people the same color as the soiled buildings."
4935,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,Someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes.
4936,0.5,0.5,0.5,He parked and got out.
4937,0.4,0.55,0.30000000000000004,“Is it really safe to leave the car …”
4938,0.5,0.55,0.55,"he was already walking toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to."
4939,0.5,0.6,0.55,"I hopped out, ran after him, and reached him just as he was knocking on the door."
4940,0.4,0.55,0.6,"Someone opened it a crack, then ushered us in."
4941,0.6,0.7,0.65,"Sometimes we'd get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges, and we'd rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up."
4942,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Inside, the building opened up."
4943,0.55,0.55,0.5,"The ceiling was high and wooden, and I could see part of a DJ’s booth down the hall."
4944,0.5,0.4,0.4,It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub.
4945,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Then I looked down and saw what had let us in.
4946,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,What up?”
4947,0.5,0.5,0.5,The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap.
4948,0.75,0.6,0.55,"“Nice, my man,”"
4949,0.6,0.55,0.5,"“Nice, my man,” he said as they clasped hands."
4950,0.30000000000000004,0.7,0.65,“Who’s the freak?”
4951,0.5,0.5,0.5,“This is someone from Ivan’s family.
4952,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,Did I ever tell you about them?”
4953,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.5,"“Yeah, one time, man, but you were pretty fucked up."
4954,0.35,0.6,0.55,"What’s your problem, kid?”"
4955,0.3325,0.6675,0.5,"It pulled back around his fingertips, which bore things that might have been nails or claws."
4956,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Under matted hair, his eyes had slit pupils."
4957,0.625,0.25,0.5,Nepthys quickly answered for me.
4958,0.35,0.5,0.4,“Girlfriend troubles.
4959,0.4575,0.5,0.5,"She came down here with someone after a party, and I don’t think it was one of your average pixies.”"
4960,0.25,0.5,0.5,“Bummer.
4961,0.6,0.6,0.6,"So, what’s the cat look like?”"
4962,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"Nepthys nodded: “It’s okay, you can trust him."
4963,0.6,0.6,0.6,"“It’s okay, you can trust him."
4964,0.5,0.5,0.55,That’s why we came here.”
4965,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,“I …I noticed him from across the room when I was looking around for Rachel.
4966,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Boston is a strange place at night.
4967,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"He was standing right in front of some blue lights, so I couldn’t see him very well, but I noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin."
4968,0.55,0.55,0.55,It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly.
4969,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He was slim, almost drawn, but he had a kind of … luster to him, I guess."
4970,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He wasn’t a person you’d describe with normal adjectives, you know?”"
4971,0.4,0.65,0.55,"You wouldn't believe half of the shit I've seen, even when I was straight."
4972,0.5,0.5,0.5,They nodded.
4973,0.55,0.55,0.5,"“Oh, totally,”"
4974,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"“Oh, totally,” said the hunchback."
4975,0.55,0.55,0.55,“I get that all the time around here.”
4976,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“He was wearing a sort of jacket …maybe blue velvet, I couldn’t tell in the dark, but it had ruffles at the throat, things like that."
4977,0.5,0.5,0.5,He really stood out.
4978,0.5,0.5,0.5,That’s why I couldn’t understand why no-one else remembered him.
4979,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He had some rings, too."
4980,0.4,0.5,0.5,"I remember that he hardly ever moved, just stared at Rachel."
4981,0.55,0.5,0.55,"Even when he talked, he hardly opened his mouth."
4982,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,I don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music.”
4983,0.5,0.5,0.5,The two glanced at each other.
4984,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,“What do you think?”
4985,0.5,0.375,0.5,asked the hunchback.
4986,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"“I’ve looked into it a little, and I do think we might be dealing with one of them."
4987,0.5,0.5,0.5625,Have you seen anyone like that in your club?”
4988,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“Not that I can remember, man."
4989,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"I can send you to a guy who knows all about them, though."
4990,0.5,0.4,0.5,It was a Friday night.
4991,0.75,0.65,0.55,"“You’re a wonder, Dvorov."
4992,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,It won’t be long before nightfall.”
4993,0.5625,0.4375,0.5,"“Oh yeah, man."
4994,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Rachel and I went out to dinner, and when we finished, she saw that there was a message on her cell phone."
4995,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"Here, let me write down how to find him.”"
4996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail, then handed it to Nepthys."
4997,0.5,0.35,0.55,"“Here you go, man."
4998,0.8325,0.7075,0.5,Good luck!”
4999,0.55,0.55,0.5,"“Thanks, Dvorov."
5000,0.65,0.55,0.4,I owe you one.
5001,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Let’s go.”
5002,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,That last one was to me.
5003,0.5,0.5,0.5425,I waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left.
5004,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"He gave me a half-hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing, and whether I should be wearing body armor."
5005,0.5,0.6,0.6,"Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then."
5006,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"Still in my initial shock, I suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked."
5007,0.3325,0.5,0.5,"The yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog: it had a leeching, heavy dimness."
5008,0.5,0.5,0.5,I saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light.
5009,0.5,0.5,0.5825,She checked it there in the restaurant.
5010,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Leaning from the rough-hewn window of one building on our right was something with long, green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill."
5011,0.5,0.35,0.55,Thirty-five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed.
5012,0.4375,0.5,0.5625,I noticed when my back hit the wall that I was walking backwards.
5013,0.4175,0.5,0.4175,"“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,”"
5014,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“We, and thousands like us, have been living separately as long as there has been a human society,” said my driver."
5015,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Her head tilted into the phone as she listened, her pleather purse on her lap, shining jet against the worn black of her snug Dead Can Dance T-shirt."
5016,0.5,0.4,0.6,I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills.
5017,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“We interact with humans, take advantage of them, grant them boons, sometimes even become their friends, but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction."
5018,0.5,0.5,0.55,"At this point, we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional."
5019,0.4,0.6,0.4,"Those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this, where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner, with the right protective spells.”"
5020,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,He took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us.
5021,0.5,0.5,0.5625,We should get started right away.
5022,0.4575,0.4575,0.5425,He saw that I wasn’t moving.
5023,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Setting an arm on my shoulder, he said, “Nathan, what you see here might be frightening, but those things you saw are people just like you."
5024,0.55,0.55,0.5,They’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms.”
5025,0.6,0.55,0.55,“Thanks.
5026,0.65,0.55,0.55,It’s very reassuring that I’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity.”
5027,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“It’s from Mitch,”"
5028,0.4,0.5,0.5,"“Nathan, you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help Rachel."
5029,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Well, she’s here and she needs your help."
5030,0.5,0.5625,0.625,"Now, the more we can do before nightfall, the better.”"
5031,0.5,0.4175,0.5,“But why are you even helping me?
5032,0.55,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"Until thirty seconds ago, I didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of …weirdness.”"
5033,0.5,0.5,0.4375,"“Nathan, I told you: my family owes yours a debt."
5034,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"In this world, one’s word is a promise."
5035,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.65,"Now, can we get going?”"
5036,0.5,0.5,0.6,I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye.
5037,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,“Only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name.”
5038,0.5,0.375,0.375,“You’ve got a deal.
5039,0.55,0.5,0.65,Let’s go.”
5040,0.5,0.55,0.5,"As we headed down the sidewalk, I said, “What is your name, anyway?”"
5041,0.55,0.55,0.55,"“What is your name, anyway?”"
5042,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,“That’s a question you learn not to ask here.
5043,0.5,0.5,0.5625,What you may call me is Nepthys.”
5044,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"Holding Dvorov’s directions, Nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway."
5045,0.35,0.6,0.35,I started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were.
5046,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence."
5047,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“Just at this corner,”"
5048,0.5,0.55,0.5,"“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east."
5049,0.4,0.5,0.65,"“we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east."
5050,0.5,0.5,0.55,East is that way.”
5051,0.5,0.625,0.625,He pointed at the wall to our right.
5052,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,“Don’t let the sun fool you.
5053,0.5,0.5,0.5,"I blinked at him, but he just kept walking until we reached the corner."
5054,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"“Okay, you might feel silly, but just turn three times to your left."
5055,0.5,0.4375,0.5,Try to keep in time with me.”
5056,0.4,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"We spun around three times, and then something flashed across Nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust."
5057,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,“I don’t know … it was going to be just us tonight.
5058,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"The blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground, and I jumped back."
5059,0.5,0.4,0.4,"When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner."
5060,0.4375,0.5,0.5,"Nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it, opening the door."
5061,0.5,0.4,0.5,“Are you coming?”
5062,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,"The sky, cupping over squat buildings, was less yellow here, and stands were set up everywhere the way I’d picture a market in the Middle East."
5063,0.5,0.5,0.35,I’m not sure I’m up for a night out.”
5064,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Nepthys took us immediately to the right, where he led us to a cart filled with herbs."
5065,0.55,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place."
5066,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,The thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland: it had the same opium-dream wise man quality I’d always given the caterpillar.
5067,0.5,0.25,0.55,I was feeling calm and private that night.
5068,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated."
5069,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Its face was small and wrinkled, with penny-sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose."
5070,0.5,0.5,0.5,it asked.
5071,0.5625,0.5625,0.5625,"“There are no finer to spice a meal, nor purer to mix a potion."
5072,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Please, let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs.”"
5073,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"“We’re not here to browse,”"
5074,0.5,0.4,0.55,"“We’re not here to browse,” Nepthys told him."
5075,0.5,0.5,0.5,“We’d like to see a man about some garlic.”
5076,0.3325,0.4575,0.4575,The thing frowned.
5077,0.5,0.5,0.4,If – ”
5078,0.55,0.5,0.55,“You know what I mean.
5079,0.65,0.65,0.5,"Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged."
5080,0.5,0.25,0.55,I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.”
5081,0.5,0.4175,0.5,It hissed thoughtfully.
5082,0.5,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"“True, true."
5083,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right – ”"
5084,0.5,0.5,0.5,he looked at me “ – to close it.”
5085,0.5,0.55,0.55,“ – to close it.”
5086,0.55,0.55,0.55,Nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart.
5087,0.44999999999999996,0.7,0.5,The latch opened under Nepthys’ left hand with a clack!
5088,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,The door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs.
5089,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,At the top was one door.
5090,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,We entered.
5091,0.5,0.5,0.5,Its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls.
5092,0.5,0.5,0.5,"On the bed was a small, ratty man."
5093,0.5,0.4,0.5,He opened one eye when we came in but did not move.
5094,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“We’re here for information about a vampire,” said Nepthys."
5095,0.15000000000000002,0.8500000000000001,0.4,"“Oh, shit!”"
5096,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.65,I said.
5097,0.4,0.4,0.5,"“Sorry, kid."
5098,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,–Would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual?”
5099,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.5,"“Wait, Nepthys – you said nothing about vampires."
5100,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Frankly, I don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire."
5101,0.5,0.5,0.4,There’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are.
5102,0.375,0.5625,0.5,"Are …look, are they as bad as people in my world think they are?”"
5103,0.6,0.65,0.7,"It’s been over a week, and I want to dance."
5104,0.375,0.4375,0.375,“I don’t know.
5105,0.4575,0.5,0.5425,"They’re almost as rare here, and I’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire.”"
5106,0.5,0.625,0.375,"“No, those people don’t usually leave stories.”"
5107,0.6,0.6,0.55,"“Oh, thanks, Nepthys, for your confidence-inspiring tales of experience."
5108,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"So they’re probably worse than we think, okay, that’s great."
5109,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,Now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an Anne Rice novel?”
5110,0.625,0.5,0.625,"Let’s go together, you know you’ll have fun once you get into it.”"
5111,0.25,0.65,0.8,“My plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against.
5112,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,Okay?
5113,0.5,0.55,0.6,"Don’t forget, she’s your girlfriend."
5114,0.4575,0.5,0.5425,"It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the ""second sight"", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times."
5115,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,Now calm down while I talk to this gentleman.
5116,0.30000000000000004,0.44999999999999996,0.35,I shut up and tried to breathe.
5117,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed, who had not moved."
5118,0.25,0.35,0.4,"“Please, accept our apologies."
5119,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"As you can see, our situation is of personal importance to the young man."
5120,0.4,0.6,0.4,Now: may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire?
5121,0.625,0.625,0.4375,It would be a great help to us.”
5122,0.25,0.5825,0.5,"She bit the inside of her bottom lip, looking at me like I was breaking her poor, sweet heart."
5123,0.4175,0.5825,0.4175,"Finally, in a pinched rasp, he said, “My information is purely for the purposes of a collector."
5124,0.6675,0.5,0.5825,“My information is purely for the purposes of a collector.
5125,0.5,0.5,0.5825,I do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm.”
5126,0.5,0.55,0.55,"“Sir, we simply want to discover whether this individual is, in fact, a vampire."
5127,0.55,0.5,0.30000000000000004,"If there is any boon that you would have us do in return, we would be glad to do it.”"
5128,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"He continued to lie in place, still breathing heavily."
5129,0.5,0.5,0.5,I tried to keep myself calm.
5130,0.5,0.55,0.5,“I have need of a certain stone that I once possessed.
5131,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness."
5132,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by a human, and only a human may handle it."
5133,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can.”"
5134,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"“Of course we will fetch you the stone,”"
5135,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“Of course we will fetch you the stone,” Nepthys assured him."
5136,0.6,0.55,0.55,“You have our thanks.”
5137,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone."
5138,0.4,0.6,0.5,"When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant."
5139,0.4575,0.5,0.5,"Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys."
5140,0.4,0.6,0.55,Nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them.
5141,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d’s light, and handcuffed."
5142,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Let’s go, you’re probably right.”"
5143,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions."
5144,0.4,0.6,0.55,Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive.
5145,0.65,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“Good evening, gentlemen,”"
5146,0.6,0.5,0.5,"“Good evening, gentlemen,” she said."
5147,0.65,0.65,0.5,"She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table, her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing, not just pressing your face into someone else’s."
5148,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“No, thank you,”"
5149,0.5,0.5,0.55,“we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?”
5150,0.5,0.5,0.5,Are you the proprietor of this shop?”
5151,0.6,0.55,0.55,"“Yes,”"
5152,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“Yes,” answered the woman."
5153,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“I am Madame Entera, at your service."
5154,0.5,0.55,0.5,She raised an eyebrow.
5155,0.5,0.4175,0.5,“Are you?
5156,0.4375,0.4375,0.625,"Well, we don’t get many customers asking about that item."
5157,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"Please, walk this way.”"
5158,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,She led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like African tribesmen.
5159,0.5825,0.4175,0.5,"The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome, with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd, floppy hats on the other."
5160,0.55,0.5,0.5,"After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside."
5161,0.5,0.35,0.6,"“Excuse me,”"
5162,0.5,0.55,0.5,“but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”
5163,0.7,0.5,0.44999999999999996,The woman laughed.
5164,0.5,0.5,0.6,"“Why, the merchandise, of course,”"
5165,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“Why, the merchandise, of course,” she said."
5166,0.55,0.5,0.55,Nepthys leaned close to my ear.
5167,0.3325,0.4175,0.5,"“This is a slave shop,”"
5168,0.3325,0.5825,0.4175,"“This is a slave shop,” he explained quietly."
5169,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The woman paused before another door, this one not barred but locked."
5170,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"As she brought out the key, she said, “We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items."
5171,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"“We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items."
5172,0.5,0.5,0.5,"We’ve had genies, indentured sorcerers, even golems and the occasional elf."
5173,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.6,It’s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it.
5174,0.35,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"If we only had a human on our staff, we could have done so ages ago and sold it off, but we have no such luck.”"
5175,0.5,0.5,0.5,She opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room.
5176,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,"“Here it is,”"
5177,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"“Here it is,” she said."
5178,0.5,0.5,0.5,"With a flourish, she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire, intricate patterns like a Czar’s jewelry box crawling down the walls."
5179,0.55,0.6,0.55,"In its center, under a spearing, white light, was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth, on which lay a gray, plum-sized rock."
5180,0.5,0.5,0.625,"“Let’s not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache?"
5181,0.55,0.5,0.55,"“A marvel, isn’t it?”"
5182,0.5,0.5,0.5,she said.
5183,0.6675,0.6675,0.5,“That such a rock could hold so much magic – it’s a wonder.”
5184,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"“That it is,”"
5185,0.5,0.5,0.5,“What would convince you to part with it?”
5186,0.5,0.35,0.6,"“You wouldn’t give me the human, would you?"
5187,0.4,0.5,0.55,"No,"
5188,0.375,0.5625,0.8125,"No,”"
5189,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"she said, seeing his expression, “that would make the stone rather useless.”"
5190,0.375,0.5,0.5,“that would make the stone rather useless.”
5191,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Nevertheless, she gave me what I can only describe as an “appraising glance”."
5192,0.55,0.5,0.55,“appraising glance”
5193,0.7,0.6,0.6,I have never felt so appraised in all my life.
5194,0.6,0.5,0.5,"“He looks healthy,”"
5195,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“He looks healthy,” she said, “how about a pint of his blood?”"
5196,0.4175,0.5825,0.5825,“how about a pint of his blood?”
5197,0.4,0.55,0.65,We don’t – ”
5198,0.5,0.5,0.6,“A pint?
5199,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Madame, I have his health to consider.”"
5200,0.4575,0.4575,0.5,I have his health to consider.”
5201,0.5,0.4,0.4,"“Half a pint, then – and his hair.”"
5202,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Nepthys turned to me.
5203,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"“Well, kid, what do you think?"
5204,0.2,0.7,0.6,I’m not giving my blood.”
5205,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“Sure, babe."
5206,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,"“As if I wanted it,”"
5207,0.4,0.6,0.65,"“As if I wanted it,” interrupted the woman."
5208,0.6,0.6,0.6,"“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,”"
5209,0.6,0.5,0.7,"“I think it’s a fair deal, considering the return,” he told me, “but it’s up to you.”"
5210,0.2925,0.75,0.625,"Come on, I don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself."
5211,0.5,0.5,0.55,“but it’s up to you.”
5212,0.5825,0.5825,0.5425,"I thought about it, then nodded."
5213,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“One half-pint of human blood, willingly given, and his fine head of hair for the stone.”"
5214,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,She took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping.
5215,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"Soon, she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl, which she put on the table beside me."
5216,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"“Roll up your sleeves,”"
5217,0.5,0.55,0.6,"“Roll up your sleeves,” she told me."
5218,0.5,0.5,0.55,"She opened the bowl and carefully, gingerly brought out a fat, dripping leech."
5219,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,It must have been larger than my finger.
5220,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,She laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm.
5221,0.4575,0.4575,0.4575,"The cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker-mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow, where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin."
5222,0.4,0.4,0.7,Let’s not waste any more time.”
5223,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,I thought that I could feel a slight itching.
5224,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"“They take about a quarter-pint each,”"
5225,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“They take about a quarter-pint each,” said Madame Entera, drawing out another skinny leech."
5226,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“They’re quick, too."
5227,0.5,0.35,0.6,We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.”
5228,0.5,0.55,0.5,Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber.
5229,0.35,0.6,0.4,"Half an hour later, I left the room pale and bald, running my fingers over my scalp."
5230,0.6,0.35,0.4,At least the barber hadn’t nicked me.
5231,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Madame Entera took me back up to the stone’s room, where Nepthys was waiting by the door."
5232,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,”"
5233,0.75,0.6,0.55,"“Thank you for doing business at our house, and I hope to see you again!”"
5234,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.6,"“Come on,”"
5235,0.625,0.4175,0.5,"“Come on,” said Nepthys, “you could use a drink.”"
5236,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,“you could use a drink.”
5237,0.5,0.5,0.5,We hit a bar on the next street over.
5238,0.5,0.55,0.55,"“Vodka, straight up,”"
5239,0.5,0.5,0.6,"“Vodka, straight up,” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, “and a Bloody Mary for my friend."
5240,0.5,0.55,0.6,“and a Bloody Mary for my friend.
5241,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,Make it extra bloody.”
5242,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"When our drinks came, he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my Bloody Mary."
5243,0.65,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"“That should help,”"
5244,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“That should help,” he said."
5245,0.55,0.5,0.6,“You could run on empty with a little of that stuff.
5246,0.55,0.5,0.55,"It won’t refill your blood supply, but while that’s in your system, you won’t even need blood.”"
5247,0.65,0.5,0.5,He grinned at me.
5248,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"“Drink up, kid.”"
5249,0.5,0.5,0.55,I took about half of the Bloody Mary in one gulp and then ate the celery.
5250,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,Nepthys slapped me on the back.
5251,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"“Okay,”"
5252,0.5,0.5825,0.5825,"“Okay,” I said, “now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?"
5253,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"“now that we’re sitting down, can you explain a little more of what’s going on here?"
5254,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"I mean, what is this place, really?”"
5255,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,He thought about that.
5256,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“I think that our world is a reflection of yours, or yours is a more boring reflection of ours."
5257,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.4,This place is just a little of both.
5258,0.5,0.55,0.6,"In America, things are still weird after the European conquest."
5259,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The natives are still here, but so is everyone else."
5260,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The Europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities.
5261,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,We aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the Grimms.”
5262,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,“What do you mean?”
5263,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Okay, take elves.”"
5264,0.5,0.5,0.55,He caught the bartender’s eye for another shot.
5265,0.5,0.6,0.6,"“You figure they’re some Lincoln-green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory, right?"
5266,0.35,0.5,0.55,Not in America.
5267,0.4,0.65,0.4,"Here, they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world, too, right?"
5268,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,Except it’s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society’s lowest rungs.
5269,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Some of them actually commit to this society, though."
5270,0.6675,0.5,0.5,There’s an amazing DJ who’s an elf.
5271,0.6,0.55,0.5,"When they do decide to do something for real, they’re always the best at it.”"
5272,0.5,0.375,0.5,He downed the second shot.
5273,0.65,0.5,0.44999999999999996,“I am glad to be out of the favor-trading scene for half a minute.
5274,0.3125,0.5,0.4375,It’s exhausting to talk to those people.
5275,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,One wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something.
5276,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"So what else do you want to know, Nathan?”"
5277,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“I don’t know …hey, what about the nature spirits, things like that?"
5278,0.5,0.4375,0.5,"I mean, where do the dryads fit in a place like this?”"
5279,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“If the tree isn’t around, the dryad isn’t around."
5280,0.55,0.5,0.5,It’s as simple as that.”
5281,0.25,0.4375,0.4375,That made me a little sad.
5282,0.65,0.6,0.55,They were always my favorite part of the Greek myths I read in elementary school.
5283,0.5,0.55,0.5,"“Well, what about you?"
5284,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“My parents came over from Russia, just like your family."
5285,0.5,0.5,0.5,"It was last February, after the winter break, that we moved in together."
5286,0.5,0.5,0.5,"My real name is a little more ethnically appropriate, but we don’t toss those around in this place."
5287,0.5,0.5,0.5,They were spirits of a certain branch of the Volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary.
5288,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected."
5289,0.55,0.55,0.5,"I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river."
5290,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.”"
5291,0.4575,0.5,0.5,He took another shot of vodka.
5292,0.375,0.5,0.6875,“Shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka?
5293,0.5,0.5,0.5,"I mean, we might have a lot of work ahead of us.”"
5294,0.4,0.6,0.5,“Are you kidding?
5295,0.55,0.5,0.55,"I can drink like a fish, kid."
5296,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Now spring was back, under the concrete, and I could smell it even here."
5297,0.5,0.5,0.6675,"We should get going, though."
5298,0.3325,0.25,0.5825,Still woozy?”
5299,0.5,0.5,0.5,“A little walking should get the stuff into your system.
5300,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Come on, let’s go.”"
5301,0.5,0.5,0.55,"As we left the bar, I asked to see the rock."
5302,0.25,0.5825,0.4175,“Why?”
5303,0.5,0.375,0.5,Nepthys asked.
5304,0.5,0.5,0.5,“I’m just curious.
5305,0.5,0.55,0.5,I want to see what a magic stone looks like.
5306,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"Don’t worry, I’ll be careful not to touch it.”"
5307,0.5,0.55,0.5,"He thought about it, then handed me the pouch."
5308,0.5825,0.5,0.5,I undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that I could see the stone inside.
5309,0.55,0.4,0.55,"It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it."
5310,0.4175,0.4175,0.4175,"As long as I looked at it, it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow."
5311,0.5,0.5625,0.625,"Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me."
5312,0.5,0.55,0.5,"I almost tripped over him, and the stone went flying out of the pouch."
5313,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"Nepthys tried to grab it, but, by reflex, I caught it first."
5314,0.6,0.6,0.5,"“Isn’t it an amazing night, Rache?"
5315,0.25,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid."
5316,0.6875,0.6875,0.6875,"“I agree,”"
5317,0.5,0.35,0.5,"“I agree,” I told him."
5318,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"The stone was as warm as human flesh now, and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat, I don’t know."
5319,0.65,0.7,0.65,Even the city feels alive when spring comes.”
5320,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air."
5321,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The air around me seemed to still sound, and light came in around the corners of my eyes."
5322,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,“Do you know what this thing does?”
5323,0.4,0.6,0.55,"I shouted, hardly able to hear myself."
5324,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.35,“I have no idea!”
5325,0.30000000000000004,0.35,0.6,but I couldn’t hear him.
5326,0.4,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"The light in the corners of my eyes rushed in, converging on the rosy glow around the stone, and for a moment I was blind."
5327,0.5,0.5,0.5825,“Taxi!”
5328,0.35,0.4,0.4,There was no sign of the stone.
5329,0.4,0.5,0.6,"“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,”"
5330,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,” said Nepthys."
5331,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,She waved down a car and pulled me in.
5332,0.55,0.55,0.55,"The girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow, and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a Celtic knot."
5333,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles, and soft, white leather boots held her feet."
5334,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"When she didn’t move, I knelt down and put a hand to her brow."
5335,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"In a few minutes, we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church."
5336,0.5,0.55,0.55,"As soon as I touched her, her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist."
5337,0.25,0.6,0.30000000000000004,I couldn’t move.
5338,0.5,0.5,0.4,"I opened my mouth to ask for an explanation, but Nepthys stopped me."
5339,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“Don’t name her ‘What did you say?’, okay?"
5340,0.5,0.6,0.44999999999999996,‘What did you say?’
5341,0.5,0.4,0.5,The next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back.”
5342,0.2925,0.4175,0.375,I was at a loss.
5343,0.5,0.35,0.5,“Amy.”
5344,0.5,0.4,0.5,Nepthys looked at me incredulously.
5345,0.5,0.5625,0.5,"“You awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone, having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer, and you name her ‘Amy’?”"
5346,0.7,0.65,0.6,"Amy smiled at me and let go of my arm, but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss."
5347,0.55,0.5,0.5,I stood up and Amy stood with me.
5348,0.6,0.35,0.44999999999999996,“So …back to our garlicky friend?”
5349,0.5,0.5,0.6675,"“I suppose so,” said Nepthys, “and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”"
5350,0.4,0.5,0.55,“and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up.”
5351,0.55,0.5,0.5,We walked back to the herb stand.
5352,0.4,0.4,0.55,"The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs."
5353,0.375,0.25,0.25,"When Nepthys opened the little man’s door, he rolled over and grinned to see us, but when Amy walked in, he blanched."
5354,0.44999999999999996,0.7,0.44999999999999996,“What!”
5355,0.35,0.65,0.55,he screamed.
5356,0.5,0.5,0.5,You woke it up?
5357,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“But …but sir,”"
5358,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“But …but sir,” I said, “are you sure she’s no help to you?”"
5359,0.5,0.5,0.5,“are you sure she’s no help to you?”
5360,0.3325,0.5,0.6675,"“Not if you named it already, you ninny, and I’m sure that you have!"
5361,0.55,0.6,0.6,I heard the pulse already.
5362,0.25,0.75,0.6675,Fools!
5363,0.25,0.65,0.7,Get out of my sight now – unless you know how to put it back?
5364,0.4575,0.4175,0.4575,…I thought as much.
5365,0.35,0.65,0.55,"Now leave, before I call the rats on you.”"
5366,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,We left.
5367,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.44999999999999996,Nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck.
5368,0.2,0.65,0.75,"“You idiot,”"
5369,0.35,0.6,0.5,“do you know how much you’ve set us back?
5370,0.4375,0.5,0.625,"I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.”"
5371,0.5,0.5,0.5,"I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts."
5372,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.65,“You’re just lucky that Dvorov isn’t my only contact.
5373,0.55,0.55,0.6,"Come on, we’re heading out.”"
5374,0.55,0.6,0.6,"ome on, we’re heading out.”"
5375,0.5,0.5,0.5,He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs.
5376,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark."
5377,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“Night comes quickly here,”"
5378,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me."
5379,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“Okay,”"
5380,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Okay,” he said as we hit the street, “we’re going to see another friend of mine."
5381,0.5,0.5,0.6,“we’re going to see another friend of mine.
5382,0.5,0.5,0.65,"First, though, we are getting you a hat."
5383,0.35,0.65,0.65,You look ridiculous with a shaved head.”
5384,0.5,0.5,0.5,"At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston."
5385,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front.
5386,0.5,0.5625,0.5,“Dead Can Dance”
5387,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Amy liked it, I think."
5388,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal."
5389,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The black door opened as we came up to it, and a pale man opened the door."
5390,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.5,"He was naked, but there was nothing to hide: his body was hairless and completely smooth."
5391,0.4175,0.5,0.625,I only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity.
5392,0.5,0.4,0.5,“he”
5393,0.5,0.5,0.5,His eyes were white.
5394,0.625,0.5625,0.5625,"From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”."
5395,0.5,0.5,0.5,“A Forest”
5396,0.5,0.5,0.625,“I’m here to see Isis.
5397,0.5,0.5625,0.5625,Tell her that Nepthys is here to see her.”
5398,0.5,0.3325,0.5,The man closed his eyes.
5399,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"A moment later, he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in."
5400,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Nepthys walked straight past him and I tried to keep up, taking Amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind."
5401,0.4,0.5,0.25,"I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at."
5402,0.55,0.55,0.35,Amy gave my hand a squeeze.
5403,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade, a vaulted, ribbed intestine of a hallway, whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic."
5404,0.7,0.7,0.55,We kissed and slipped inside.
5405,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Then there was a door, which opened as we approached."
5406,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Inside, the space opened into a wide, square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size."
5407,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer."
5408,0.5,0.5,0.5,These were incontestably male.
5409,0.55,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"said the woman, slithering up across the furs to sit up."
5410,0.625,0.6675,0.5,"As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked – naked and stunning."
5411,0.5,0.5,0.5625,I had an urge to cover Amy’s eyes.
5412,0.6675,0.625,0.5,“It’s been years since I’ve seen you.
5413,0.6,0.6,0.65,"Please, come and sit beside me, and introduce your friends.”"
5414,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,”"
5415,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"“This man is here in search of his lover, who was stolen from him in the human world,” said Nepthys, ushering us toward the woman in silk."
5416,0.55,0.6,0.5,"“The girl is …surprising,”"
5417,0.35,0.55,0.65,"“And I am Isis,”"
5418,0.5,0.55,0.55,"“And I am Isis,” said the woman, offering her hand to me."
5419,0.65,0.65,0.6,"I took it and, dropping to one knee, gave her fingers a small kiss."
5420,0.55,0.6,0.55,"“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,”"
5421,0.75,0.6,0.55,"“It is an honor to meet you, Lady Isis,” I said."
5422,0.75,0.6,0.5,"She laughed, liquid, alluring, alarming."
5423,0.8,0.8,0.6,"“Oh, precious!"
5424,0.6,0.5,0.5,"He has lovely manners, Nepthys, despite his poor taste in hats."
5425,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"You may leave out the ‘Lady,’ boy."
5426,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.65,I don’t wish to be reminded of how old I actually am.”
5427,0.55,0.6,0.55,A wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes.
5428,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.4,"Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they’d taken down the crucifix."
5429,0.55,0.55,0.6,"“Now, how can I help the elegantly mannered friend of my Nepthys and his surprising young charge?"
5430,0.55,0.55,0.6,Nepthys poured out wine for three of us.
5431,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“May I have a little more of what you gave me before, Nepthys?”"
5432,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,I asked.
5433,0.5,0.5,0.5625,He poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me.
5434,0.5825,0.6675,0.5,"The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth."
5435,0.5,0.4175,0.5,Isis’ nostrils twitched slightly.
5436,0.55,0.6,0.55,This story might be interesting.
5437,0.5,0.5,0.5,Does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved?”
5438,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“It was part of the price for this girl, who was a rock at the time,” explained Nepthys."
5439,0.6,0.6,0.5,"“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,”"
5440,0.55,0.5,0.6,"“I have a feeling that she was worth the trade,” I added."
5441,0.75,0.65,0.4,"Amy, still holding my hand, smiled."
5442,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“She may be at that,”"
5443,0.5,0.4375,0.625,"“She may be at that,” said Isis, gazing at her."
5444,0.65,0.5,0.6,"“That sweet, small nose, and her soft lips – she’d kiss well, I should think, if gently."
5445,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ’s moving sermon."
5446,0.5,0.375,0.5625,She has good blood under her cheeks.
5447,0.8125,0.8125,0.625,"Good, round breasts, too, even though they’re small, they suit her.”"
5448,0.4375,0.5625,0.5625,"Amy didn’t blush, and I hoped that she didn’t understand what Isis was saying."
5449,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"“She would have been worth it,” Nepthys interrupted, “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact."
5450,0.35,0.55,0.6,“if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact.
5451,0.55,0.55,0.6,He was going to give us valuable information for her.”
5452,0.5825,0.5825,0.5,"“Now I understand why you’re here,”"
5453,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"“Now I understand why you’re here,” said Isis."
5454,0.5,0.5,0.5825,“So what do you need to know?”
5455,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,”"
5456,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"“You know I wouldn’t come to you if I could get this information another way,” said Nepthys apologetically."
5457,0.6,0.4,0.5,"“Mmm,”"
5458,0.4575,0.5,0.375,I couldn’t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant.
5459,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“I think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire.
5460,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Isis …you know some way to locate the undead, don’t you?”"
5461,0.5,0.5,0.5,“I do.
5462,0.5,0.55,0.55,Describe this one to me.
5463,0.5,0.6,0.65,"If I know him, I can find him."
5464,0.5,0.5,0.55,"If not, you’ll have to bring me something to work with.”"
5465,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,Nepthys looked at me.
5466,0.5,0.5,0.5,"I thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin, his dark hair, the way that light seemed to flow around him, as best as I could."
5467,0.5,0.7,0.44999999999999996,"Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts."
5468,0.5,0.55,0.6,"When I had told her all that I could remember, she blinked her black lashes and said, “I remember him.”"
5469,0.5,0.65,0.4,“You do?”
5470,0.625,0.625,0.625,Nepthys could hardly believe her.
5471,0.8500000000000001,0.8500000000000001,0.75,“That’s amazing!”
5472,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,“It is.
5473,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,I would have sworn to you that he was dead.
5474,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,He should be.
5475,0.35,0.6,0.55,I hope that you can do a better job than the last lot.”
5476,0.5,0.5,0.6,"She sat up, running her hands along her pale, round thighs."
5477,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“All right, then."
5478,0.5,0.375,0.5,Let me see if I can find him.”
5479,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands.
5480,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,A dark glow coalesced around her palms.
5481,0.625,0.625,0.5425,"Amy leaned forward, looking amazed."
5482,0.375,0.5,0.4375,Her candy lips twisted into a frown.
5483,0.5,0.5825,0.5,"The dark glow grew stronger and larger, filling the air for about a foot around her hands."
5484,0.5,0.6,0.5,"Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling’s blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd."
5485,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"In her palms, the droplets of blood swelled into small pools."
5486,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"The dark glow began to flicker, and Isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry."
5487,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.65,"She didn’t shed a bead of sweat, and I didn’t even see her draw a breath, but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame."
5488,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,Then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake.
5489,0.5,0.6,0.4,"The blood in her palms, still filling up, began to ripple."
5490,0.5,0.625,0.375,"He glanced at me with honest concern, probably the first honest moment he’d shown me: ‘Is she all right?’"
5491,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"Her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out, splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs."
5492,0.5,0.55,0.5,"She gasped and the dark glow went out, taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam."
5493,0.5,0.5,0.65,"Now Nepthys lunged forward, took her by the arms."
5494,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"She shook her head, rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something."
5495,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,“What did you say?”
5496,0.5,0.5,0.55,"She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest."
5497,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"For the first time, she looked vulnerable."
5498,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"“I found your vampire,”"
5499,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,“but he might know that someone’s looking for him. He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.
5500,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,He’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden.
5501,0.5,0.55,0.55,You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can.”
5502,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Hurry, though, and you might find him before he leaves.”"
5503,0.55,0.55,0.7,A twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants.
5504,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.65,“One of these will lead you out.”
5505,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door."
5506,0.5,0.55,0.5,"He stood to go, but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment."
5507,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames."
5508,0.5,0.375,0.5625,I turned back to the door.
5509,0.6,0.65,0.65,"“Come on, Amy,” I said, “he’ll be along soon.”"
5510,0.5,0.375,0.5625,Nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall.
5511,0.5,0.375,0.5,"When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood."
5512,0.4,0.5,0.5,"He offered it to Nepthys, who opened the box: on velvet lining, a wooden hammer and two stakes."
5513,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“Mountain ash,”"
5514,0.4175,0.3325,0.5825,"“Mountain ash,” said Nepthys."
5515,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me."
5516,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"“I really hope we find your Rachel,”"
5517,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“I really hope we find your Rachel,” he said."
5518,0.6,0.55,0.55,"“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,”"
5519,0.5,0.4,0.5,"“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys."
5520,0.55,0.65,0.6,“I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.”
5521,0.6,0.6,0.55,"In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us."
5522,0.5,0.5,0.5,The pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart.
5523,0.75,0.7,0.5,"“Yo, my man Nep!"
5524,0.55,0.5,0.5,You got the sucker already?”
5525,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.7,"“No, but we got a tip that he might be in your club."
5526,0.5,0.5,0.5,Have you seen him?”
5527,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“Here, man?"
5528,0.35,0.65,0.65,You’re crazy.
5529,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.65,I haven’t had a vampire here since you and – ” Nepthys shot a wicked look at him.
5530,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"“Anyway, long time, man.”"
5531,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,“That’s odd.
5532,0.75,0.7,0.6,"On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air."
5533,0.5,0.55,0.65,Do you mind if we check it out anyway?
5534,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,I have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere.”
5535,0.375,0.6875,0.375,"Dvorov glanced over his shoulder, a little nervous."
5536,0.55,0.65,0.7,"“I guess, man, but be quick."
5537,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.6,"I don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong, you know?”"
5538,0.5,0.4175,0.5,We’ll be in and out in a minute.”
5539,0.55,0.55,0.5,Nepthys stepped in and Dvorov walked us towards the dance floor.
5540,0.5,0.5,0.5,Dvorov asked us.
5541,0.5,0.5,0.5,"“No, he said that his research was purely academic, not for hunters.”"
5542,0.25,0.5,0.4375,“Bummer.
5543,0.25,0.4175,0.3325,"I guess I probably should’ve known, though."
5544,0.5,0.55,0.55,"I mean, he is kinda tight about that stuff.”"
5545,0.35,0.4,0.44999999999999996,He didn’t look very surprised.
5546,0.5,0.5,0.55,"“Anyway, this is the dance floor, man."
5547,0.55,0.55,0.55,Good luck.”
5548,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before."
5549,0.5,0.5,0.6,Then I saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking.
5550,0.5,0.5,0.5,"I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes."
5551,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.44999999999999996,I tried to slip along the edge of the crowd.
5552,0.4,0.65,0.65,"Things with scales and claws kept flailing against me, pressing me into the wall, but I took a breath and kept moving."
5553,0.4175,0.5825,0.5825,My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat.
5554,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.30000000000000004,"Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold."
5555,0.5825,0.5,0.5,Then I felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that Amy was following me.
5556,0.5,0.4,0.55,I gathered her under my arm.
5557,0.55,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"Dvorov was somewhere behind me, too, negotiating delicately through his patrons."
5558,0.4175,0.5,0.5,It slumped to the floor and I realized that it was a werewolf.
5559,0.5,0.5,0.5,She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd.
5560,0.55,0.55,0.55,I thought that my odds were better on the dance floor.
5561,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.4,"Holding Amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers, I started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this."
5562,0.4575,0.5,0.5425,"A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs."
5563,0.5,0.6,0.5,"A woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me, fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing."
5564,0.4175,0.5825,0.5,"Then a looming shape to my right fell away, and I saw him in a flash of the strobe, his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd."
5565,0.55,0.55,0.55,"The creature blocking my vision moved back, but I had seen all that I needed to see."
5566,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"A bleeding, eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me, but I ducked around it and toward the bar."
5567,0.5,0.5,0.4,"When she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar."
5568,0.25,0.7,0.4,"I slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before, a mountain of wet, veined flesh, and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm."
5569,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,It was Dvorov.
5570,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.4,He pulled my ear down to his mouth.
5571,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,"“You seen enough, man?”"
5572,0.4,0.65,0.5,he shouted.
5573,0.65,0.6,0.6,"“Yes,”"
5574,0.6,0.65,0.55,"“Yes,” I called back, “I saw him!"
5575,0.5,0.5825,0.6675,“I saw him!
5576,0.5,0.6,0.6,He’s sitting right there at the bar!”
5577,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Dvorov tried to peek through the crowd, but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing."
5578,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"“I don’t think he’s there,”"
5579,0.35,0.4,0.5,“It must have been wishful thinking.”
5580,0.35,0.8,0.7,"“No, I saw him!"
5581,0.5,0.8,0.65,"I have to hurry, too!"
5582,0.5825,0.6675,0.5825,Who knows how long he’ll stick around?”
5583,0.44999999999999996,0.8,0.7,"“Listen, man, he’s not there!"
5584,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.65,"I’m telling you, it’s not even worth checking the bar!”"
5585,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,"I turned to keep going, but he caught my arm again."
5586,0.44999999999999996,0.8500000000000001,0.65,"“Don’t do this, kid!"
5587,0.5,0.5,0.55,"It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer."
5588,0.30000000000000004,0.5,0.5,It’s a dumb idea.
5589,0.44999999999999996,0.7,0.55,"Even if you did find this vampire cat, he’d tear you apart!"
5590,0.375,0.625,0.625,"I shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs, getting almost to the edge of the dance floor."
5591,0.3125,0.625,0.375,"Suddenly, Amy screamed."
5592,0.5,0.75,0.5,I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away.
5593,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off."
5594,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,The dancers near us tried to clear some space.
5595,0.4175,0.6675,0.5,"He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back."
5596,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself."
5597,0.35,0.65,0.44999999999999996,"On the floor was Dvorov’s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood."
5598,0.4,0.55,0.35,Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand.
5599,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorov’s blood.
5600,0.55,0.55,0.55,"“He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,”"
5601,0.55,0.6,0.55,"“You spotted our boy, didn’t you?"
5602,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"I bet his hide-out is nearby, too."
5603,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there."
5604,0.5,0.65,0.55,Let’s hurry.”
5605,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip.
5606,0.5,0.4,0.5,The crowd parted for us.
5607,0.5,0.65,0.44999999999999996,The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us.
5608,0.55,0.5,0.55,"In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room."
5609,0.4,0.7,0.7,“Come on!”
5610,0.5,0.55,0.55,shouted Nepthys.
5611,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.5,"We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us."
5612,0.5,0.6675,0.5825,"He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held."
5613,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"Luckily, the vampire turned off after three stories."
5614,0.5,0.4,0.5,"He ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors, but Nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me."
5615,0.4,0.6,0.5,I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us.
5616,0.5,0.5,0.5,Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment.
5617,0.55,0.6,0.5,"Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight."
5618,0.5,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"When I came to the door at the end of the room, it looked like it had been torn off its hinges."
5619,0.4,0.6,0.6,"I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him."
5620,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,A black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral.
5621,0.5,0.55,0.55,"The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me."
5622,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter."
5623,0.4,0.5,0.5,"When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, ""No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us."
5624,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere."
5625,0.4175,0.4175,0.4175,"I couldn’t tell how many people were running, much less where they were."
5626,0.55,0.6,0.55,"On the steps in front of the altar, I saw pale forms and realized that they were Rachel and two other women."
5627,0.55,0.65,0.5,"He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn’t see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable."
5628,0.4,0.6,0.65,"Then I heard Nepthys shout, “Nathan!"
5629,0.55,0.7,0.6,“Nathan!
5630,0.5,0.75,0.55,Behind you!”
5631,0.5,0.4,0.5,"There was Nepthys, on the other side of the pews, holding the wooden box in his hand."
5632,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,"He tossed it to me, and I just barely had it open before I saw the vampire again, turning to face me."
5633,0.5,0.5,0.5625,I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes.
5634,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair."
5635,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,"I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face."
5636,0.3325,0.75,0.4175,"The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin."
5637,0.30000000000000004,0.65,0.35,My arms shook from the force of his throw.
5638,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand.
5639,0.55,0.55,0.5,"He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin."
5640,0.4175,0.5825,0.5825,"I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive the ash spike into his heart."
5641,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews."
5642,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.35,I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me.
5643,0.4,0.65,0.4,I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine.
5644,0.2925,0.625,0.5,"The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw."
5645,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb."
5646,0.4,0.55,0.35,"Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open."
5647,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.30000000000000004,I must have fallen to the floor then.
5648,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,"I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone."
5649,0.5,0.55,0.5,"The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness."
5650,0.375,0.5,0.5,I thought I heard Rachel’s voice blearily calling for me.
5651,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,"I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek."
5652,0.5,0.55,0.6,"A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.”"
5653,0.5,0.4,0.5,“Nathan.”
5654,0.6,0.44999999999999996,0.5,I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected.
5655,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,Then my eyes opened and Amy handed me the hammer and stake.
5656,0.5,0.5,0.55,I stood and turned toward the altar.
5657,0.4375,0.625,0.4375,The vampire was walking just steps ahead of me.
5658,0.55,0.65,0.6,"I stepped up behind him and raised my hands, which almost seemed to be glowing."
5659,0.35,0.6,0.4,"Then the stake came down into his back and one, two, three strikes with the hammer drove it in."
5660,0.4,0.55,0.5,The vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth.
5661,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Behind me, Amy was kneeling beside Nepthys, whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug."
5662,0.5,0.625,0.5,I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.
5663,0.2,0.7,0.4,"Rachel, her clothes torn and her face drawn, looked like she might cry when she saw me."
5664,0.7,0.7,0.6,I pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me.
5665,0.65,0.6,0.6,"“My fuckin’ hero,” she whispered."
5666,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving."
5667,0.55,0.5,0.5,She nodded and he took her arm.
5668,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong."
5669,0.35,0.55,0.5,"Saturday morning, I woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home."
5670,0.4,0.5,0.55,"I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck."
5671,0.5,0.5,0.5,"A couple of them remembered seeing her leave, but none of them had seen the thin man with her."
5672,0.5,0.5,0.5,Nathan’s Bylichka
5673,0.5,0.4,0.5,"I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light."
5674,0.5,0.5,0.5,I caught a taxi back to the church.
5675,0.35,0.55,0.6,"It was still a mess, but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared."
5676,0.5,0.5,0.5,I walked across what had been the dance floor.
5677,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The church was completely different now: sunlight fell through the stained glass, catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry, healthy warmth into the edges of the room, through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights."
5678,0.4,0.35,0.35,"I realized that Rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and I had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which, if she were in a situation where I should be doing something, would probably be never."
5679,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Standing in the center of the church, I took out my cell phone and called the police."
5680,0.35,0.5,0.6,“I need to file a missing persons report.
5681,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,…Rachel Frieze.
5682,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Last night, walking on West 2nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock."
5683,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,What?
5684,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"…But, sir, this is an unusual situation."
5685,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"She didn’t come home last night, none of her friends have seen her."
5686,0.5,0.5,0.6,"But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly."""
5687,0.4,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"…Sir, if she’s in any danger, it will probably be too late to help her by that time."
5688,0.09999999999999998,0.8,0.30000000000000004,"My girlfriend has disappeared, I don’t even know where to start looking, and I need help!"
5689,0.5,0.4,0.35,"…Yes, sir."
5690,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,I understand.”
5691,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight.
5692,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Walking out of the church, a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise."
5693,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,A cold front must have hit while I was inside.
5694,0.4,0.55,0.4,"Glancing down the street, I realized that I didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time, and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran."
5695,0.5,0.6,0.55,"I pulled my T-shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go, but I wasn’t ready for cold."
5696,0.4175,0.5,0.5,Walking didn’t build up much heat; it just moved the air enough to chill me more.
5697,0.4,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"After I’d walked about a block, a car rolled up behind me."
5698,0.35,0.55,0.5,It slowed down as it neared me and I started to worry.
5699,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,This wasn’t the best of neighborhoods.
5700,0.5,0.65,0.6,I kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it.
5701,0.5,0.6,0.5,I heard an automatic window roll down.
5702,0.5,0.6,0.5,"“Hey,” said a male voice, “do you need some help?”"
5703,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,I turned around.
5704,0.4,0.35,0.44999999999999996,"The man looked over forty, and he was driving a car I’d be afraid to drive on this street."
5705,0.5,0.5,0.5425,"“It’s a long way to anywhere worth going,”"
5706,0.5,0.5,0.5,he said.
5707,0.5,0.55,0.5,“Would you like some help?”
5708,0.75,0.5625,0.5625,"“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,”"
5709,0.55,0.55,0.5,"“Ah, I think I’m fine, thanks,” I told him, and turned back to the sidewalk."
5710,0.5,0.35,0.55,"As I got older, I shook the tales off with a nod and a ""Yes, Nana."""
5711,0.6,0.7,0.6,"“Really, I’d like to help."
5712,0.55,0.4,0.55,"Please, hop in."
5713,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,You don’t look dressed for this weather.”
5714,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,I glanced back over my shoulder.
5715,0.4,0.6,0.55,"“No thanks, sir!"
5716,0.6,0.5,0.5,I’m just fine.
5717,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Really, don’t worry about me.”"
5718,0.6,0.55,0.65,"“Nathan Spencer, I offer you help."
5719,0.375,0.5625,0.8125,I advise that you not refuse me a third time.”
5720,0.5,0.7,0.55,"I stopped and looked back at him, surprised."
5721,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,He met my eyes coolly.
5722,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.5,“How do you know my name?”
5723,0.5,0.5,0.5,“I know your family.
5724,0.5,0.55,0.65,Get in.
5725,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"We have a lot of work ahead of us, and it’s best to start now.”"
5726,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""Yes, Nana."""
5727,0.5,0.5,0.5,I walked around the car and got into the passenger seat.
5728,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Before I had my belt on, we were rolling forward."
5729,0.5425,0.4175,0.5,"“Okay,”"
5730,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“Okay,” I said."
5731,0.5,0.5,0.55,“I’m in the car.
5732,0.4575,0.5825,0.5,"Now, will you tell me how you know my family, and how you happened to be driving by just now?"
5733,0.4575,0.4575,0.4575,"I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything."
5734,0.55,0.55,0.55,And how did you recognize me when – ”
5735,0.35,0.65,0.65,“That’s enough!
5736,0.5,0.5,0.6,I can only answer one question at a time.
5737,0.55,0.6,0.6,I know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours.
5738,0.44999999999999996,0.7,0.55,"I am here now because you called for help, and no-one else would answer.”"

5775,0.5,0.4375,0.5,Ochoa has played in the majors for five different teams starting in 1995.

5778,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Going into this season, he was a career .281 hitter."

5780,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""He gives you a lot in all areas,"" Angels general manager Bill Stoneman said."

5782,0.55,0.5,0.6,"He's a right-handed bat, which complements Palmeiro off the bench."
5783,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,The answer is no.
5784,0.5,0.5,0.5,He accepts his role with a club and he's a team guy.
5785,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,Ochoa will join the club today in Anaheim before tonight's game against the Yankees.

5794,0.5,0.5,0.55,--It's because of Molina: The Angels felt they could part with Fabregas because of the play of catcher Jose Molina.
5795,0.55,0.25,0.5,"ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The Anaheim Angels got help where they felt they needed it most, agreeing to trade for Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Alex Ochoa only hours before Wednesday's nonwaiver trading deadline."
5796,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Molina spent all season at Triple-A Salt Lake before joining the major-league club July 17 to replace his injured brother, Bengie."
5797,0.5425,0.5,0.5,"Bengie is expected to be activated from the disabled list today, giving the Angels both Molina brothers on the active major-league roster for the first time."

6149,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Almost 1,800 men were assembled n late 1944 to join the top-secret unit called the 509th Composite Group."
6150,0.5,0.25,0.5825,"Col. Paul Tibbets, the pilot who would drop the world's first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Japan, was commander of the unit and chose the men."
6151,0.5,0.5,0.5,A mission to end a war
6152,0.5,0.5,0.5,"And the first person he chose to join him was Karnes, though he couldn't reveal the mission to Karnes."
6153,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Karnes was Tibbets' adjutant, the man in charge of writing the orders and cajoling the transfer to the unit of servicemen proficient in bombing, mechanics, ordnance, engineering and communications."
6154,0.4,0.5,0.6,Tibbets hated paperwork.
6155,0.5,0.5,0.5,Karnes thought it was a breeze.
6156,0.5,0.625,0.625,They were a wartime match that changed the world.
6157,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"AUSTIN, Texas -- Tom Karnes was dialing for destiny, but not everyone wanted to cooperate."
6158,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Japan surrendered within days of the detonation of the atomic bombs that killed 140,000 people in Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and 70,000 in Nagasaki three days later."
6159,0.4175,0.4175,0.5,"The story of the 509th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived in a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other war-weary U.S. units that resented sharing a small Pacific island with the 509th, which appeared exempt from combat."
6160,0.4375,0.375,0.4375,Tinian Island was the staging area where the 509th moved after its creation in the desert.
6161,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Karnes has never spoken publicly about his role as Tibbets' right-hand administrative aide.
6162,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,He never even told his story to students in his 40 years of teaching college.
6163,0.4,0.5,0.5,"War is hell, he says, and when it was over, he wanted to come home and rejoin his young family and not dwell on it."
6164,0.5,0.55,0.55,He earned a doctorate in history from Stanford University and taught Latin American history at Tulane University and Arizona State University.
6165,0.5,0.5,0.55,Next week marks the 57th anniversary of the atomic bombings.
6166,0.5825,0.5,0.5,"Each year on Aug. 6, ""I always think of Paul Tibbets and how he handled unbelievable responsibility,"" Karnes said."
6167,0.5,0.5,0.5,Karnes met Tibbets when the 29-year-old bomber pilot walked into Karnes' office at Wendover Army Air Field on the Utah-Nevada border.
6168,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,Karnes was the personnel and classification officer.
6169,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He was only a captain, but he had been left in charge at Wendover the day Tibbets surprised them by landing a B-29, a new plane no one at Wendover had seen."
6170,0.5,0.55,0.6,Tibbets had just been ordered to organize a combat force to drop a bomb being developed by a secret enterprise known as the Manhattan Project.
6171,0.5,0.5,0.5,He was searching for a remote installation to train bomber crews and support units in total secrecy.
6172,0.6,0.6,0.55,Tibbets instantly liked the isolation and vast size of Wendover and the surrounding Bonneville Salt Flats.
6173,0.7,0.55,0.4,"And he immediately liked Karnes, who showed him around the base."
6174,0.55,0.5,0.5,"In Karnes, Tibbets found a kindred spirit -- and a handball partner."
6175,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,"Both were smart, disciplined, quiet men who thrived on efficiency, perfection and self-reliance."
6176,0.5,0.5,0.5,Each had skills the other admired.
6177,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Tibbets was a decorated, top-gun pilot, but Karnes could wrangle the military rule book as well as Tibbets could fly."
6178,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,He was tracking down men to join a group so secret he couldn't admit it existed.

6182,0.5,0.5,0.5,""""
6183,0.5,0.4575,0.5425,Tibbets quickly returned to Wendover after that first visit to set up his headquarters.
6184,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,His first order appointed Karnes adjutant for the 509th.
6185,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"No one was allowed to talk about what they saw or heard, even though most of the 509th had no idea why they were there, except that 15 B-29s were being modified to carry a heavy load."
6186,0.5,0.4,0.5,Karnes and his staff read outgoing mail to make sure no secrets slipped out.
6187,0.5,0.55,0.5,"Karnes hated to pry, and skimmed over personal portions of the letters."
6188,0.4175,0.5825,0.5,Phone calls were monitored.
6189,0.5,0.4575,0.5,An undercover force of Manhattan Project security agents infiltrated the base and bars in the little town of Wendover (population 103) to spy on airmen.
6190,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,"Karnes knew the 509th was preparing for a special bombing mission, but he had no idea what kind of bombs were involved."

6196,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.4,"By spring, the 509th prepared to move to Tinian Island, near Guam and Saipan."
6197,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"That would put the B-29s about 1,500 miles from Japan -- a 13-hour round-trip flight."
6198,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Karnes was deluged with orders for inoculations, equipment, transfers and promotions."
6199,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,He was calling bases all over the United States to line up their transfer to the desert outside Salt Lake City.
6200,0.5,0.4375,0.4375,"Karnes arrived on Tinian on May 18, 1945, as part of an advance team that flew in the five C-54 transport planes of the 509th."
6201,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"On May 29, 1,200 men arrived on the troopship Cape Victory after a five-week trip from Seattle."
6202,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"Tinian Island had been captured from Japan, and the Seabees, the construction arm of the Navy, had built two large airfields."
6203,0.5,0.55,0.55,The 509th took North Field and stayed in relative isolation from other B-29 units on the island.
6204,0.5,0.5,0.6,"Karnes handed out bunk assignments, choosing the mess officer, Chuck Perry, to share his tent."
6205,0.5825,0.4575,0.5,"Karnes had his own Jeep, and went to the beach and to evening movies shown by other units as often as he could."
6206,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,Not until the day before Tibbets and his crew flew to Hiroshima was the 509th told what was happening.
6207,0.5,0.4,0.65,"The word spread: ""This is it."

6211,0.5,0.5825,0.5,Three B-29s had gone ahead to check the weather at Hiroshima and two other possible bomb sites.
6212,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,Two other B-29s left in two-minute intervals after Tibbets so their crews could take photos and drop devices to measure radiation and other effects of the bomb.
6213,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,Tibbets got the word only an hour from Hiroshima that the city's weather was clear.
6214,0.4375,0.625,0.625,"As they approached, Tibbets braced for Japanese anti-aircraft fire."
6215,0.4,0.65,0.4,"Early in the flight, the crew had inserted a plug of uranium into the 9,000-pound bomb, nicknamed ""Little Boy."

6217,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Ninety seconds from the bomb drop, Tibbets put the plane on auto-pilot."
6218,0.5,0.55,0.5,The crew slipped on dark glasses to prepare for the blinding flash of the bomb.
6219,0.35,0.6,0.65,"At 8:15 a.m. Hiroshima time, the pneumatic bomb-bay doors opened and ""Little Boy,"" equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT, fell out."
6220,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The Enola Gay climbed, and Tibbets fought to turn the plane in the air-bending, 155-degree the crews had been practicing off Tinian for months."

6222,0.5,0.4175,0.4175,"""Who says this?"" another commanding officer asked Karnes."
6223,0.5,0.5,0.5,He pushed off the dark glasses because he couldn't see to fly.
6224,0.4,0.6,0.5,"When the bomb exploded as planned 1,890 feet over Hiroshima, Tibbets' mouth tingled, and he tasted the lead fillings in his teeth."
6225,0.4,0.65,0.5,"A minute later, the shock wave hit."
6226,0.44999999999999996,0.65,0.44999999999999996,The crew was horrified by the purple mushroom cloud that climbed to 10 miles and looked as if it would engulf the Enola Gay.
6227,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"More shocking was the city of Hiroshima, which was on fire and bubbling like tar."

6229,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Back on Tinian, Karnes had gone to bed."
6230,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,But he didn't sleep long.

6239,0.55,0.5,0.5,He knew the war would soon be over and he would be heading home.
6240,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,A yearof secrecy and hard work wasover.

6243,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor."
6244,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Jobs were scarce in other steel-exporting countries, and labor laws were either non-existent or allowed employers to pay much less for work."
6245,0.4375,0.5625,0.5,"Labor costs in America continued to go up, draining US companies of their resources, while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities."
6246,0.5,0.375,0.5,"On a worldwide scale, newer materials such as aluminum, plastic, and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad."
6247,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies."
6248,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"America’s steel remained unsold, flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy."
6249,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Since this problem was a national one rather than a local one, the problems that were occurring in Youngstown were not unique."
6250,0.25,0.6675,0.3325,"Youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry, but it was not alone."
6251,0.4,0.4,0.55,"The problem was a national one, involving many more mills and issues than Youngstown’s alone."
6252,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.65,“You just can’t solve a nation-wide problem in a single city.”
6253,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The decline of the world steel market affected not just Youngstown but the entire steel community in America.
6254,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,Trying to prop up one city’s mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry.
6255,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,The Save Our Valley Campaign: Lack of Funds and Plans
6256,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Eventually, some religious leaders involved in the Ecumenical Coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the Save Our Valley Campaign."
6257,0.5,0.5,0.5,"As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region."
6258,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,The events that would follow this date (known as Black Monday) are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope.
6259,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people."
6260,0.3125,0.5,0.4375,"The people of Youngstown, being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive."
6261,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations."
6262,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.5,"People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds."
6263,0.4375,0.5,0.5,"The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively."
6264,0.4,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"Without funds, the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy."
6265,0.4575,0.4175,0.4575,The Save Our Valley Campaign also lacked one essential component: an actual concrete plan.
6266,0.4,0.5,0.5,No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems.
6267,0.3125,0.5,0.375,"Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the situation."
6268,0.5,0.4,0.5,"People clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization, but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work; the people of Youngstown were, after all, not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general."
6269,0.4175,0.5,0.4575,"Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down."
6270,0.4,0.55,0.55,"Without funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good."
6271,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.35,"In effect, it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything."
6272,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did."

6274,0.5,0.5,0.5,United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit.
6275,0.5,0.55,0.5,Initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs.
6276,0.5,0.4,0.4,"However, it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight, the international branch was not."
6277,0.5,0.5,0.5625,"Rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away, the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open."
6278,0.4,0.55,0.5,"The higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with Youngstown and its plight, attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening."
6279,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Actually, one main reason for the behavior of the USWA was that union leaders really had no idea what to do."
6280,0.5,0.4,0.5,"No one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before, and none of the leaders of USWA, not even president Lynn Williams, knew what could be done."
6281,0.4,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario, the USWA simply ignored what was going on in Youngstown, hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself, or at least not spread any further than it already had."
6282,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism."
6283,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do."
6284,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.6,"Therefore, they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone."
6285,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Regionalism
6286,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Youngstown is the name of the major city area, but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself."
6287,0.375,0.5,0.4375,"Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even the takeover of a steel company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had."
6288,0.5,0.4,0.5,"Boardman, Poland Township, Struthers, Lowellville, Warren, Lordstown, Canfield, Niles, and many other towns and districts are crowded around Youngstown (see Figure 3)."
6289,0.5,0.5,0.55,"People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town."
6290,0.55,0.55,0.5,"However, although traffic is heavy between each separate district, each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity, educational system, heritage, history, and even food."
6291,0.5,0.4,0.5,"For example, Struthers is a poor town with a large Slovak population, where education is generally better than in surrounding towns, but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread."
6292,0.5,0.375,0.5625,Most people in Struthers are either Orthodox or Baptist.
6293,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools."
6294,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Its residents are mainly Italian and Roman Catholic, with a small concentration of Methodists on the east side."
6295,0.6,0.55,0.6,"Unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns, and the streets are clean and well kept."
6296,0.5,0.35,0.4,"With many more cultures, religions, and economic levels living in close proximity to one another, a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area: regionalism."
6297,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Each town, with their own identity, instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations, which dictates many habits, exchanges, and interactions between populations."
6298,0.30000000000000004,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others."
6299,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"With so much regional tension, it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause, even one that would save their jobs and their futures."
6300,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,"Workers from Poland Township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from Campbell, and citizens of Struthers would become suspicious of people from Boardman, even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing."
6301,0.5,0.6,0.5,"A lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement, because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together."
6302,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate."
6303,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.4,In this way the people of the Mahoning Valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride.
6304,0.2925,0.5425,0.4175,"These well-intentioned efforts ultimately failed, leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind."
6305,0.5,0.4,0.5,Conclusion: The Aftershock and the Significance of Black Monday
6306,0.35,0.6,0.44999999999999996,"The efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons: the failure of the international steel market, the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, the refusal of the USWA to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear, and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies."
6307,0.5,0.5,0.5,"What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level, and perhaps it is not."
6308,0.4,0.55,0.55,"But to the thousands of people living there, the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic, political, and social futures."
6309,0.35,0.55,0.4,"Because of the mills and their conspicuous absence, hundreds of people were uprooted, forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities."
6310,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Hundreds more joined the unemployment lines, or even began living on the streets."
6311,0.5,0.375,0.375,"For the people of Youngstown, Black Monday was not just a historical event- it was the most important event in their lives."
6312,0.5,0.5,0.55,"The steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves, something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on."
6313,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Even though they eventually failed, the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children."
6314,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.4,But why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail?
6315,0.4,0.55,0.5,"When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry."
6316,0.5,0.5825,0.5,"Most importantly, the problem in Youngstown was a nationwide problem."
6317,0.4,0.5,0.5,"Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level."
6318,0.5,0.5,0.5,In 1802 James and Daniel Heaton discovered ore and coal lining Yellow Creek in an area outside of Youngstown known as Poland Township.
6319,0.4375,0.5625,0.5625,"Their blast furnace, “Hopewell,” was the very first blast furnace in the area."
6320,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products."
6321,0.4,0.55,0.5,The Decline of the Northeastern Ohio Steel Market: Why Did Attempts by Union Leaders and Concerned Citizens to Revive the Steel Industry Ultimately Fail?
6322,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Youngstown also was a major railway crossroads, due to its strategic position between Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago."
6323,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"In fact, “More rail cars passed under the Center Street Bridge [a major bridge in Youngstown] per day than any other location in the country.”"
6324,0.5,0.5,0.5,"During the 19th century, the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far East Coast (Massachusetts and Eastern Pennsylvania) to the Ohio Valley Pittsburgh regions of the Northeast, including the Mahoning Valley and the Hanging Rock region of Ohio and Kentucky."
6325,0.5,0.5,0.5,"By 1880, Youngstown’s population had grown to nearly 16,000, which meant it had doubled in size over a twenty-year period."
6326,0.65,0.55,0.5,"The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills."
6327,0.35,0.4,0.55,"This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard."
6328,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.4,"Despite the Congress of Industrial Organization’s successful efforts to establish a national steel workers’ union, the industry barely survived the Depression years."
6329,0.55,0.55,0.5,"Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth."
6330,0.3125,0.5,0.375,"This prohibited strikes and lockout, angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down."
6331,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie."
6332,0.4,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"Most importantly, Youngstown’s steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive."
6333,0.5,0.4575,0.5,"September 19, 1977 is a date that few people in Youngstown, Ohio will ever forget."
6334,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Old technology was not replaced, obsolete methods were not updated, and almost none of the industry’s profits were being utilized to help modernize."
6335,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.55,Black Monday and the Crash of the Steel Industry
6336,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin."
6337,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.5,"Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide."
6338,0.5,0.4175,0.5,Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement.
6339,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"However, it was clear that, in the words of USWA president Lloyd McBride, “If you can’t make a buck, you get out of the business.”"
6340,0.35,0.55,0.4,"On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close."
6341,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country."
6342,0.4,0.5,0.5,Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets.
6343,0.3125,0.5,0.5625,"Without an industrial or a residential base, commerce shrank considerably."
6344,0.4,0.5,0.6,"It was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills, the city of Youngstown would soon become a ghost town, inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape."
6345,0.5,0.5825,0.6675,"The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways."
6346,0.5,0.4,0.4,Attempts to Save the Mills
6347,0.5,0.4,0.5,"The very first thing that the workers could do was “to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,” says Ed Mann, a local union leader and organizer."
6348,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"“to get up a petition to stop the shutdown,”"
6349,0.5,0.5,0.55,"The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington."
6350,0.5,0.5,0.5,"However, the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in Washington, since Youngstown’s political influence had died with its industry."
6351,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,"The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members."
6352,0.35,0.4,0.5,The petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure.
6353,0.55,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"Next, workers decided to form the Ecumenical Coalition, an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the Youngstown works."
6354,0.5825,0.6675,0.6675,The Coalition drafter letters to the Lykes Company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively.
6355,0.35,0.6,0.4,"Although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback, for the people of Youngstown and the surrounding area, it meant disaster."
6356,0.5,0.4375,0.5625,"Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government."
6357,0.35,0.5,0.5,"Here, too, they were ignored."
6358,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"The Coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills, so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed."
6359,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.55,"Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown."
6360,0.5,0.5,0.55,"They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over."
6361,0.375,0.4375,0.5,"The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill."
6362,0.5,0.5,0.5,"These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export."
6363,0.25,0.6,0.35,The Decline of the World Market
6364,0.5,0.5,0.5,The efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up.
6365,0.5,0.5,0.625,"In fact, American steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports."
6366,0.55,0.5,0.55,"Foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make, and was often of higher quality than domestic steel."
6367,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Foreign steel companies invested in their factories, updating their technology and replacing their equipment often."
6368,0.5,0.5,0.5,Foreign steel was also much cheaper.
6369,0.375,0.5,0.5625,"Wage hikes, although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the US, made American steel far more expensive."
6370,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"You can mix them with a 30/30/40 mix of potting soil, worm casings and clay."
6371,0.5,0.5,0.5,Or you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at that estate sale last year and get to mixing.
6372,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Dust can fly into your mouth and eyes very easily.
6373,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"If the fertilizer in the mix is what I think it is, that wouldn't be pretty."
6374,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,Use gloves to break up the soil with your fingers.
6375,0.35,0.5,0.65,3. Make bombs.
6376,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.6,Form the mix into balls of any size from sling-shot-pellet up to softball.
6377,0.5,0.5,0.5825,You're going to be throwing them.
6378,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Mine were more or less matzoh-ball size and shape, out of habit."
6379,0.75,0.6675,0.6675,This worked out pretty well.
6380,0.55,0.5,0.6,"Today, I kept it simple."
6381,0.5425,0.4175,0.5,"I chose one abandoned property a few minutes from downtown, and two vacant lots."
6382,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,The leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the freeway offramps.
6383,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,First lesson learned -- you need at least two people to seedbomb from a vehicle .
6384,0.5,0.6,0.6,The first responsibility should be driving safely.
6385,0.35,0.5,0.44999999999999996,"I found this hard to do while also avoiding cops, dealing with the camera and the car window, scoping out angles of approach for throwing, etc."
6386,0.5,0.65,0.6,"Seedbombing combines elements of childhood disgruntled mudbomb-hurling; the balance of meticulousness and zen that good gardeners possess; and my own forte, the invisibility and vigilance of a sniper."
6387,0.25,0.5625,0.5,I ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap.
6388,0.5,0.5625,0.5,But you'll have to take my word because a camera at that moment would have been crazy.
6389,0.5,0.5,0.44999999999999996,You want both tidiness and easy access.
6390,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Plus, those things are crumbly."
6391,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.44999999999999996,I made eight; the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag for half an hour.
6392,0.65,0.55,0.65,And the last lesson -- have fun .
6393,0.5,0.55,0.5,It's play.
6394,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Seedbombing is a hit-or-miss way for change to take root, pun intended."
6395,0.5,0.4,0.5,It's chlorophyll graffiti.
6396,0.5,0.5,0.5,No one I know is getting digg'd or favrd yet for throwing color and scent around the ghetto.
6397,0.5,0.375,0.5625,Do it to see how it feels.

6406,0.30000000000000004,0.65,0.55,There is one over-riding message to this -- Quit being such a goddamned perfectionist.
6407,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Yes, yes, I know, you know of much better places to never throw those seedbombs you haven't made."
6408,0.6,0.5,0.55,You could get better soil if you put it on the shopping list.

6410,0.5,0.55,0.55,It also requires a certain attitude.

7656,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.6,"Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed."
7657,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight."

7659,0.625,0.5625,0.5,"His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected."
7660,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.55,These thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home.
7661,0.625,0.625,0.375,"It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last."
7662,0.6,0.55,0.5,"Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead."
7663,0.8,0.55,0.6,"I'm almost done, and the happy ending is just falling into place."
7664,0.4175,0.5825,0.5,"As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door."
7665,0.5,0.4,0.55,"Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume."
7666,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He ran the last distance, crested the hill puffing to reveal Arthur below, walking to the carriage parked before Allan's house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle's roof."
7667,0.3325,0.5,0.5825,"Arthur paused in the door, looking up at Allan for a moment; then he turned and shut the door behind him."
7668,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"I hardly dare to think it, but – I may finish this story!"
7669,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.55,The driver snapped the reins and set the horses on.
7670,0.5,0.55,0.5,"As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself."
7671,0.5,0.5,0.5,The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows.
7672,0.5,0.55,0.55,"He watched as the carriage drew still more distant, the horses' hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway."
7673,0.5,0.5,0.5,"When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself."
7674,0.44999999999999996,0.6,0.44999999999999996,He turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done.
7675,0.4375,0.625,0.5,"A mass of flaming wood stood before him, heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house."
7676,0.5,0.4,0.44999999999999996,"As he thought this, a sinuous wind encircled the house, slipping through the walls to chill him."
7677,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"It was a moment before he realized what else had changed: near the wall, beneath his window, was a stump with black and ancient bark."
7678,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,"In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre."
7679,0.5,0.6675,0.5825,"His thoughts were not of the act's futility, nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing; instead, all that filled his mind was the tree's constant presence in his life, growing with him and beside him, its persistent reminders that he had higher, truer things to write, the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake."
7680,0.4,0.55,0.5,"His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers."
7681,0.4575,0.375,0.5,But he did not weep.
7682,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all."
7683,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,The papers and the lantern's flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on Allan's window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door.
7684,0.4,0.55,0.55,"Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood."
7685,0.5,0.4,0.55,"He stepped slowly beneath the branches, a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great, swirling eddy, a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow's last breath."
7686,0.4175,0.5,0.5,"Allan wandered beneath the trees for a time, thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog, strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate."
7687,0.5,0.5,0.5,"He considered Arthur's intervention; considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested, to write stories that others would read; for after all, what purpose writing if not to be read?"
7688,0.5,0.5,0.5,"Indeed, if he still could not, he could at any time follow Arthur's advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality."
7689,0.5,0.55,0.5,Perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind.
7690,0.5,0.4175,0.5825,"He found himself along the bank of a low, wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current."
7691,0.5,0.625,0.625,"As it turned to the deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: a beech, smooth bark a gray-green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark, cracked trunks of the nearer trees; great pines, a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three-stroke symbol of the British King; a towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him."
7692,0.5,0.4175,0.5425,"As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants."
7693,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,There was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass.
7694,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"Emerging from between the antediluvian trunks, Allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped."
7695,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Before him, roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream, grew a stand of black willows."
7696,0.5,0.55,0.55,"Fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet; the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees, still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers, sprang up where branches reached the ground."
7697,0.4,0.4,0.5,"Though the elders' trunks fell and died, their children, first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead, continued unabated, a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors."
7698,0.5,0.6,0.55,"Allan stumbled forward, jaw slightly slack, until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted, three-trunked willow whose waists were each larger than Allan himself."
7699,0.5,0.4175,0.5,"After filling his pen, Allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk's right-hand corner."
7700,0.2,0.5,0.25,"Collapsing at its base, Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan, a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks, falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream, flowing through the ground beneath them."
7701,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.5,"Its thin, drawn fingers framed the bloated moon, whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly."
7702,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.4,"The great, jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author, who gazed up through his window's tiny frame with trepidation."
7703,0.44999999999999996,0.4,0.55,Allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him.
7704,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"His pen flickered forth, words dancing out from its nib."
7705,0.55,0.55,0.5,In the author's eye gleamed the lantern's reflection – or was it a reflection?
7706,0.5425,0.3325,0.5,"For while the lantern's spark shivered in the chill breeze, this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner's pen, scratching out the rhythm of the willow's fingers."
7707,0.55,0.55,0.5,"The frenzied writing ceased at last, the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort."
7708,0.375,0.625,0.4375,"After all that – so near the end, to lose control again."
7709,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"His breath returning to its normal rhythms, he dared to look at the page before him."
7710,0.5,0.5,0.55,"His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders."
7711,0.625,0.5,0.625,"""Come, darling,"""
7712,0.5,0.55,0.5,"His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow."
7713,0.5,0.5,0.5,They took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting.
7714,0.55,0.55,0.55,"For a few yards, they kicked up dust along the roadway; then they raised their hooves and took to the air."
7715,0.30000000000000004,0.6,0.30000000000000004,"She gaped, afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand."
7716,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky."
7717,0.7,0.65,0.55,"Above them, the Milky Way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached."
7718,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.6,Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window.
7719,0.2,0.75,0.7,"""Damn you,"""
7720,0.25,0.75,0.5,"""Damn you,"" he cried, ""will you never leave me be?"
7721,0.2925,0.6675,0.4175,"""will you never leave me be?"
7722,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Shall I never finish a story in peace?"""
7723,0.25,0.7,0.44999999999999996,"He pounded his desk in vain, cursing the foul muse that drove him."
7724,0.5,0.5,0.5,"The next day, Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well-furnished parlor."
7725,0.55,0.5,0.5,"""Cucumber sandwich?"""
7726,0.75,0.55,0.55,"""Thank you, Arthur."""
7727,0.5,0.30000000000000004,0.4,"The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards."
7728,0.5,0.375,0.5,"In a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial, he refilled their glasses."
7729,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""How is the writing these days, my dear Mr. Clemm?"""
7730,0.35,0.55,0.55,"""Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason,"""
7731,0.30000000000000004,0.4,0.5,"""Perfectly dreadful, my dear Mr. Mason,"" Allan sighed."
7732,0.65,0.6,0.6,"""I had a perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before…"""
7733,0.55,0.55,0.55,"""Before that blasted impulse came over me and I started writing like Edgar Poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others, thank Heaven."""
7734,0.3325,0.5,0.4175,Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation.
7735,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""I'm not familiar with Mr. Poe's works, but I assume you're referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic."""
7736,0.5,0.5,0.6,"""It's far from a 'penchant,' Arthur."
7737,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill."""
7738,0.5,0.5,0.5,The Black Willow
7739,0.35,0.6,0.55,"""How perfectly awful."""
7740,0.44999999999999996,0.55,0.55,Arthur grimaced at the vivid description.
7741,0.35,0.55,0.55,"""I'm sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption."""
7742,0.5,0.55,0.44999999999999996,"""I know,"" Allan replied, ""but how am I to do that?"
7743,0.4,0.35,0.5,"""but how am I to do that?"
7744,0.3325,0.5,0.5825,"You know I do not wish to make my stories thus; but it is my nemesis, confronting me anew at every turn!"""
7745,0.35,0.55,0.55,Arthur raised a critical brow.
7746,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"""Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy."
7747,0.375,0.625,0.5,"Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish."
7748,0.5,0.5,0.55,"Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right."
7749,0.375,0.5,0.625,"There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least."""
7750,0.55,0.5,0.55,"""It is true,"""
7751,0.4175,0.5825,0.5825,"""It is true,"" Allan admitted, fidgeting with his cufflinks, ""that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher."
7752,0.35,0.5,0.5,"""that I would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher."
7753,0.4,0.5,0.6,"I've even tried rewriting the corrupted sections, but once my characters have gone down that road, nothing can recall their former life."
7754,0.4575,0.5,0.4575,"My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road."""
7755,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd."""
7756,0.35,0.44999999999999996,0.4,"His hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night, and his clothing had a rumpled look as if, by mere proximity, it had taken on the aspect of his weariness."
7757,0.4,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin."
7758,0.4175,0.5,0.5,He scratched the back of his dark-haloed head and blinked bleary eyes.
7759,0.55,0.65,0.7,"""I would drive it out,"""
7760,0.35,0.5,0.4,"""I would drive it out,"" he said softly, ""but I fear for what would remain."""

7763,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"""Perhaps you require a rest from writing,"" suggested Arthur."
7764,0.5,0.55,0.5,"""You might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat, improve your disposition."""
7765,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""Perhaps it would,"""
7766,0.4375,0.5,0.5625,"""Perhaps it would,"" Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit."
7767,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"""I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off."
7768,0.7,0.55,0.5,"You have been a gracious host, as always."""
7769,0.5,0.5,0.5625,Arthur rose and shook his hand.
7770,0.5,0.5,0.5,"""So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,"""
7771,0.625,0.5,0.5,"""So dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home,"" he said."
7772,0.4,0.6,0.6,"""I hope soon to see you in better sorts."""
7773,0.5,0.55,0.5,They parted and Allan made his way pensively from Arthur's gate.
7774,0.44999999999999996,0.35,0.55,"He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust."
7775,0.55,0.65,0.55,The reply came from above him and Allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree.
7776,0.55,0.55,0.55,"""I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today,"""
7777,0.6,0.6,0.5,"""I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today,"" said Nathan, ""so I thought I'd wait here for you."""

7779,0.5825,0.5825,0.5,"Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton."
7780,0.5,0.375,0.375,"""So, Allan,"""
7781,0.5,0.5,0.55,"""So, Allan,"" said Nathan, unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside, ""how goes life for the quintessential American author?"""

7783,0.4375,0.5,0.4375,"""I wouldn't know,"""
7784,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.6,"""I wouldn't know,"" replied Allan dryly, before continuing in another tone entirely."
7785,0.25,0.6,0.6,"""I destroyed another story last night, Nathan."""
7786,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,"Leaning against his tree, Nathan shook his head."
7787,0.5,0.5,0.5825,"""You mean, finished another story."""
7788,0.6,0.65,0.5,"""Yes, it is finished!"
7789,0.625,0.5,0.5,Ended!
7790,0.4,0.7,0.5,Never again shall it see the rosy-fingered dawn!
7791,0.35,0.55,0.5,"Nathan, you've read these abominations of mine."
7792,0.4,0.55,0.55,"You know just as well as I that they have no future, no potential."
7793,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.6,"Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best."
7794,0.5,0.6,0.55,"""So instead, you would write – what?"""
7795,0.6,0.65,0.55,"""Something saleable; something worth reading, worth writing!"
7796,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"On a sunny Sunday afternoon, the waiting list was an hour long."
7797,0.5,0.5,0.55,"After hemming and hawing and assessing my food stash (contents: 10 saltines), I decided to go for it anyway."
7798,0.375,0.5,0.4375,"By the time I got to Asheville, I was nearing the end of my journey and the bottom of my wallet."
7799,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.5,"By the time I finally got a seat at the counter, I was starved."
7800,0.5625,0.5625,0.5625,"It took me about thirty seconds to pick out the Charleston Chicken Sandwich: ""grilled marinated free-range chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti, romaine lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise""."
7801,0.5,0.5,0.5,Free range?
7802,0.5,0.375,0.5,Cranberry?
7803,0.5,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,Havarti?
7804,0.55,0.55,0.55,"While I waited for the food, I checked out the back of the store where Tupelo Honey Cafe hawks their homestyle wares: preserves, pickles, salsa, honey, t-shirts, aprons and all sorts of mini-advertisements for the restaurant."
7805,0.6,0.5,0.5,"I've visited plenty of farm-to-fork restaurants, and this one may be the best I've seen at self-marketing."
7806,0.5,0.55,0.5,"There's nothing wrong with it: the food in those jars is probably delicious, though I question whether the $10 tupelo honey had to come from Florida or if it's produced locally."
7807,0.5825,0.5,0.5,"Either way, it's nice to see a restaurant built on ethics that also happens to be incredibly busy."
7808,0.44999999999999996,0.44999999999999996,0.55,"Some of that is surely due to good marketing, but the real reason for its popularity is this:"
7809,0.75,0.625,0.5425,"That sandwich was so good, I found myself eating slower and slower with each bite to savor it more completely."
7810,0.5,0.5,0.6,"The potatoes were light and un-greasy; the flavors were perfectly balanced; the chicken was juicy and rich; and let's be honest here, I'm always happier eating dead animals when I know they've lived a good life."
7811,0.6,0.55,0.55,I found myself silently thanking the chicken for its delicious contribution.
7812,0.55,0.65,0.6,I will never forget you.
7813,0.5,0.5,0.5625,I stopped so I could take the rest home and taste it again later.
7814,0.55,0.44999999999999996,0.5,"On another topic, I made a discovery there in the Tupelo Honey Cafe, one which I'd like to share with you now."
7815,0.5,0.5,0.55,"If you're going to a busy restaurant and want great service, bring a camera."
7816,0.5,0.5,0.6,"Take a few photos of the menu, the kitchen, the food."
7817,0.44999999999999996,0.5,0.4,"No sooner had I taken the above photo, when a server (not even my server) appeared at my elbow."
7818,0.5,0.5,0.5,But.
7819,0.55,0.5,0.5,"Now, I'm not saying the service before my camera-flash was bad, because it was awesome."
7820,0.55,0.5,0.5,"When I'd posted on Facebook that I was coming to town, no fewer than three people told me I just had to visit the Tupelo Honey Cafe ."
7821,0.5,0.5,0.65,"But wow, it sure improved once I appeared to be some sort of food critic or travel writer."
7822,0.55,0.55,0.55,"Which, it just so happens, I am."
7823,0.55,0.55,0.65,"But even if you're not, try this out sometime."
7824,0.55,0.55,0.55,"I can't guarantee it'll work, but I personally will do it againand probably back it up with a stellar review, just like the one I've given the Tupelo Honey Cafe."
7825,0.5,0.7,0.65,"Okay, that's it!"
7826,0.55,0.5,0.65,"I could talk about Asheville for weeks, but it's time to move on."
