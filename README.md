# fundingdominance
This repo contains all code associated with my research project Funding Dominance. This includes the R script of the statistical analysis, python code for EmoBERT (NLP model for emotion analysis), and a basic facial expression classifier program (the interesting part of this is stored at https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace.git)
